Quantum Field theory in curved spacetime is a well-established branch of modern physics, which has allowed the achievement of novel results since Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation \cite{Hawking}. Within this framework, we consider the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, considered as a classical external field. That is, all matter fields are considered using quantum field theory, with the only exception of the external gravitational field, that remains satisfying the classical Einstein field equations of General Relativity \cite{DeWitt,birrel}.

In this context, an important role is played by the quantum stress energy tensor \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) of the quantum field, which is used as a source in the so called semiclassical Einstein's equations to take a look at the quantum corrections to the background geometry caused by the quantization of matter fields \cite{birrel,york,lousto-sanchez}. For this reason, it is very useful to have explicit analytical expressions for the renormalized stress tensor. This quantum stress tensor and the expectation value of the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) of a quantum field \(\varphi\) are the main objects to be determined from quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

The exact determination of \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) for a generic spacetime is very cumbersome, and some techniques have been developed and applied to this problem, including numerical ones \cite{candelas,koffman,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,owen1,owen2,Folacci,FT}. However, for the case of massive fields, there exist a method, called the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action approach, in which one assumes that the vacuum polarization effects can be separated from the particle creation, for masses of the fields sufficiently large. This method allow us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action as an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. From the effective action, the quantum stress energy tensor can be calculated by functional differentiation with respect to the metric. This approach, based on proper time expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field, can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds, whenever the Compton's wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature \cite{DeWitt,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,popov,owen1,owen2,Folacci}.

In a previous paper \cite{owenmonopole1} we took the first step in the investigation of vacuum polarization effects of quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a point-like global monopole, using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique to obtain analytical expressions for the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) in this background spacetime. We used the simple model, discovered by Barriola and Vilenkin \cite{barriola-vilenkin}, which leads to global monopoles as heavy objects appeared in the early universe as a result of a phase transition of a self-coupled scalar field triplet whose original global $O(3)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)$. In this systems, the scalar field plays the role of order parameter which is nonzero outside the monopole's core, where it is concentrated the main part of the monopole's energy.

Previous works that consider quantum fields in global monopole systems includes the analysis of massless scalar fields \cite{hiscock,mazzitely-lousto,bezerra1}, and the calculation of the quantum stress energy tensor for a massless spinor field \cite{bezerra2,bezerra3}.

In \cite{owenmonopole1}, we construct various approximations for $<\phi^{2}>$, each one proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $\left[a_{k}\right]$, starting from the leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{2}\right]$, up to the next to next to next to leading term, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $\left[a_{5}\right]$. In terms of the mass $\mu$ of the quantum scalar field, the leading approximation lead to $<\phi^{2}>$ proportional to $\mu^{-2}$, whereas the higher order approximation involve powers $\mu^{-8}$.  We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation.

The results obtained in \cite{owenmonopole1} for the field fluctuations of the quantized massive scalar field in the global monopole background shows that taking into account higher order terms substantially improve the approximation, for which we concluded that for this spacetimes, we need to use the next to next to next to leading term to obtain a good description of the vacuum polarization.

This situation was in contrast with that obtained for other spacetimes with spherical symmetry, as the one describing a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, for which previous studies showed that the next to leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{3}\right]$, provides a reasonable good approximation \cite{matyjasek4}.

In this paper we continue the study of vacuum polarization effects in the spacetime of the global monopole. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime. This expression, which is an expansion in powers of the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field, proportional to coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coefficient $\left[a_{3}\right]$, is used to obtain the leading approximation for the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor of the quantum field by functional differentiation with respect to the metric

\section{The Schwinger-DeWitt effective action for the quantum massive scalar field in the global monopole background}

In this section we present the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action for a quantum massive scalar field in the global monopole background, which is the main result of this paper. We begin by introducing the quantum effective action, which is a generalization of the standard effective action for quantum fields in curved spacetime. We then proceed to construct the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action for the quantum massive scalar field in the global monopole background, using the method described in \cite{owenmonopole1}.

A: This is a very good question. The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a way of calculating the quantum effective action for massive fields in curved backgrounds. It was developed by DeWitt and Schwinger in the 1960s, and it has been used to study a wide range of physical phenomena, including electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.
The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is based on the idea that the quantum effective action is a functional of the field variables and their derivatives.

One of the unresolved problems in fundamental physics is the problem of the electron's internal structure.
In classical physics, this problem manifests itself in the fact that a point charge possesses an infinite mass related to the energy
of the electrostatic field created by the charge. In quantum electrodynamics, a point electron leads to the occurrence of divergences in loop graphs.

Apparently, a first attempt to resolve this problem has been made by Abraham and Lorentz within the theory of an electron suggested in Refs.~\cite{ablo,ablo1}.
Another attempt to resolve the problem is Wheeler's idea of `charge without charge'~\cite{wheelbook} where an electric charge is regarded as a
wormhole containing force lines of an electric field. Within such model, the region where the force lines enter the wormhole looks like a negative charge,
and the region where the force lines emerge from the wormhole mimics a positive charge. Also, numerous attempts have been made to find regular solutions
in classical and nonlinear electrodynamics both in the presence  and in the absence of the gravitational
field~\cite{Born:1934gh,heis,Markov:1970hv,Markov:1972sc,Bronnikov:1979ex,Datzeff:1980tg,Bonnor:1989iw,Davidson:1992kr,Herr:1994,Zaslavskii:2010yi,Finst:1999,Bronn:2000,Habib:2009,Zaslav:2010,Dzhunushaliev:2016bnh}.
One should also definitely mention the popular approach to the classical model of an electron using the Einstein-Dirac~\cite{Finster:1998ws}
and Kerr-Newman~\cite{KNold,KNold1,KNold2,KNold3,KNold4,KNold5,KNold6,KNold7} solutions (an extensive bibliography on the subject can be found in Ref.~\cite{Burinskii:2011id}).

In the present paper we consider a model of an electron on the assumption that its internal structure is determined by quantum gravitational effects.
We suppose that such effects can be approximately described by modified Weyl gravity suggested in Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.
This enables us to represent the electron as a composite object whose interior region is described by modified Weyl gravity and the exterior region~-- by Minkowski spacetime. In turn, in both regions, there is a Dirac spinor field that ensures the presence of a spin of $1/2$ in the system. To describe the interior region, we will use the solution obtained in  Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom} which is embedded in an exterior flat spacetime. In addition, notice that, since Weyl gravity (as well as modified Weyl gravity considered here) is conformally invariant, metrics differing by a conformal factor are the same solution. Physically this can be interpreted  as the presence in the interior region of fluctuations of the metric conformal factor

The research found that an innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers.

A similar inbuilt instinct may be the reason why girls have always liked to play with dolls, cosmetics or toys based on domestic life, it said.

An innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers

But the impact of feminism on parents, advertising and media may be a reason why girls have been less keen on dolls, make-up and kitchen toys in recent years, according to the research paper.

Girls are more likely than boys to be influenced as they grow up by parents, the adults and children around them, and what they read and see on television, it said, while boys stick to boys’ toys.

The study produced by a team led by psychologists from City, University of London, was based on evidence collected by different researchers across the Western world over decades, with some dating back to the 1930s.

It said: ‘Despite methodological variation in the choice and number of toys offered, context of testing, and age of child, the consistency in finding sex differences in children’s preferences for toys typed to their own gender indicates the strength of this phenomenon and the likelihood that it has a biological origin.’

The paper added that there were robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.

This, the study said, ‘indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.’

The findings come at a time of deepening controversy over the choice of toys made by children, and heightened awareness over transgender issues.

The study found that 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with more fashionable than traditional toys. Aeroplanes were popular, which may have been to do with Amelia Earhart (pictured) and other female aviators

Last week the Church of England told schools that in the interest of avoiding transgender bullying, teachers in its schools should ensure ‘a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment.’

The City study said that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.

In 1932, an experiment ‘found that girls played with a toy aeroplane for similar times to boys.’

This may have been because at the time ‘female aviators were in the news; Amy Johnson flew from England to Australia in 1930, and Amelia Earhart flew solo across the Atlantic in 1932.’

Some attempts to study children found that boys tended to play aggressively even if they were given traditional girls’ toys.

‘Other toys, not necessarily male-typed, can afford aggressive play,’ the study said.

In 1980, it said, one set of psychologists ‘noted in their observation that boys played with a toy food mixer as if it were a machine gun.’

In recent times, girls have been less likely to play with dolls and other toys once considered female.

‘One interpretation is that , over the years, girls have been exposed to increasing pressure to play with neutral-typed toys as the volume of advertising to children and expansion on the number and type of children’s media outlets have increased enormously,’ it said.

Paraphrased The answer is as follows. A recent study conducted by Dr. Brenda Todd of City, University of London found that as boys age, they spend more time playing with toys that are typically associated with their gender, such as those typically considered masculine toys.
Answer:Here is a question.What do you think could be the reasons behind this trend?
Based on the study, the trend observed in boys' toy preferences as they get older could be attributed to different factors. One possible reason could be socialization, as boys are exposed to certain types of toys and activities that are considered ""masculine"" from a young age. Additionally, gender stereotypes and societal expectations may also play a role in shaping boys' toy preferences.
Question:What do you think are some potential implications of this trend for toy manufacturers and retailers? 
The trend observed in boys' toy preferences as they get older could have significant implications for toy manufacturers and retailers, as it suggests a shift in consumer behavior and potentially a decrease in demand for ""gender-neutral"" toys. This may require companies to adapt their marketing strategies and product offerings to better cater to the preferences of young boys.

\label{intro}

Gravitational accretion of matter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) that resides in the center of most, if not all, galaxies is what powers active galactic nuclei (AGN, \citealt{Rees84}). This very efficient process produces large amounts of energy across the entire spectrum that can be detected at cosmological distances. Not only is radiation emitted, but also large amounts of matter are injected back into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This process is known as feedback, and it is believed to play a major role in the coevolution of the SMBH and the galaxy (\citealt{DM05}; \citealt{HE10}).

More than half of the observed type-1 AGN present signatures of photoionized gas in their soft X-ray spectrum, the so-called warm absorbers (WA), that are seen as absorption features superimposed to the continuum (e.g., \citealt{Rey97}; \citealt{Geo98}; \citealt{Cre03}). With the advent of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy after the launch of {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and {\sl Chandra}{}, it was observed that these absorbers were blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of their host galaxy, typically by hundreds to thousands of km s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{Kaa00}; \citealt{Kas01}). Since they were outflowing, they were injecting kinetic energy and mass back into the ISM and therefore they were potential candidates to be a source of cosmic feedback. It is now considered that the regular WAs have, in general, little impact on their surroundings, with the exception of their most extreme version: outflows with very high velocity, ionization state, and column density, known as ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), which can have a significant impact on their host galaxy (\citealt{Tom12, Tom13}; \citealt{Laha16}).

The dominant launching mechanism of these outflows is still a matter of debate as they present a wide range of velocities, degrees of ionization, and column densities. They range from thermal winds arising the from inner edge of the torus, which is eroded by the intense radiation field (\citealt{KK01}), and winds launched from the accretion disk by radiative means (\citealt{PK04}) or magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms (\citealt{KK94}; \citealt{Fuk10a, Fuk10b}). In addition to this, after many years of observations and monitoring of AGN, another type of transient wind has been identified and studied: high-column density, fast, obscuring winds that eclipse the inner X-ray source of AGN on relatively short time scales. A number of objects have now shown this kind of transient phenomenon, for instance NGC 1365 (\citealt{Ris07}), Mrk 766 (\citealt{Ris11}), Mrk 335 (\citealt{Lon13, Lon19}), NGC 5548 (\citealt{Kaa14}), NGC 3783 (\citealt{Meh17}), and now also NGC 985 (\citealt{Ebr16}). 

NGC 985, also known as Mrk 1048, is a nearby ($z = 0.043$, \citealt{Fis95}), bright ($F_{\rm 0.3-10~keV} = 2.2 \times 10^{-11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, \citealt{Ebr16}) Seyfert 1 galaxy with a distinctive ring shape, produced by a recent galactic merger. This source is known to host a WA in X-rays (\citealt{Kro05,Kro09}) as well as an UV absorber (\citealt{Ara02}). During a {\sl Swift}{}~monitoring program in 2013, the source was found to be in a very low soft X-ray flux state. A triggered joint {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST observation found that some intervening very dense gas was occulting the central X-ray source (\citealt{Par14}). In the most recent observations in 2015, taken 12 days apart also with {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST, we found that the source was emerging from this obscured state. The first analysis of the X-ray broad band and UV spectra were presented in \citet{Ebr16}

\section{Observations and data reduction}
\label{obs}

The {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~observations of NGC 985 were performed in two epochs, one in 2015 and the other in 2016. The first observation was taken on 2015-01-15, lasting for about 6.5 ks, and the second one was taken on 2016-01-13, lasting for about 4.5 ks. Both observations were performed in the medium filter, and the first observation was also taken in the extended timing mode (ETM). The ETM observation was performed in the standard mode, and the second observation was in the extended timing mode (ETM). The observations were taken in the standard mode with the EPIC-pn detector, and in the ETM mode with the EPIC-MOS detectors. The data were processed using the standard {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~pipeline version 12"

Question:What type of data did Ebrero et al. (2016) analyze to gain insights into the physical processes during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN?
Answer:Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
Ebrero et al. (2016) analyzed data from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to gain insights into the physical processes during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN.
Step 2: Understand what is being asked.
The question asks about the type of data that was analyzed by Ebrero et al. (2016) to understand this transition.
Step 3: Provide a clear answer.
Ebrero et al. (2016) used X-ray broad band and UV spectra obtained from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to analyze and gain insights into the physical processes occurring during this transition.
Therefore, my answer would be:
'Ebrero et al. (2016) analyzed X-ray broad band and UV spectra obtained from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to gain insights into the physical processes taking place as an active galaxy undergoes a transformation from an obscured state to an unobscured state.'
Question:Sure! Here's a question based on the previous context and questions:
'Can you elaborate on why studying X-ray broad band and UV spectra are particularly important for understanding the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to unobscured active galaxy, as demonstrated by Ebrero et al. (2016)? What unique information do these two spectral bands provide that other observational techniques may not capture?'
Answer:What are some other important insights or findings that Ebrero et al. (2016) presented in their article regarding the transition of the active galaxy from an obscured to an unobscured state?

 In addition to analyzing the X-ray broad band and UV spectra, Ebrero et al. (2016) also reported on several other significant findings related to the transition of the active galaxy. They observed a decrease in X-ray absorption, indicating a reduction in obscuring material surrounding the central supermassive black hole. The researchers also noted an increase in UV emission, suggesting an enhancement in the accretion rate onto the black hole during this transformation. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex physical processes occurring during this transition and contribute to our understanding of how active galaxies evolve over time.
Question:Sure thing! Based on the last piece, here are the major takeaways in tweet format:

🔥 Key findings: Ebrero et al. (2016) studied an active galaxy's transition from obscurbed to unobscured state using XMM-Newton & HST observations. Their study revealed a decrease in X-ray absorption, accompanied by an increase in UV emission, indicating enhanced accretion onto the SMBH. #astronomy #activegalaxies

Fourteen primary and intermediate schools in the area have teamed up with a local trust to create the programme Fuel the Need.

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

Fuel the Need is being run by Manuel Dalton, who runs the Dalton's Gym Charitable Trust, which in turn operates a community based gym in Upper Hutt City.

Mr Dalton is a self-described Upper Hutt boy, an ex-soldier with a philanthropic drive to help out the community where he was born and bred.

At the end of 2014 he met with principals from schools in the region so they could work out what the need was. The group deduced about 50 children a day were turning up to school without lunch, although he believed that could be on the conservative side.

""To me that was a big enough number to prompt me to do something about it.""

Mr Dalton immediately got to work, getting the gym's chiller reinstated, having two people get food handling and hygeine certificates and getting approval in principle from the council to run the operations.

There is a database of about 20 people willing to volunteer their time to the programme, and a deal has been struck with Pak 'n Save to supply the food at $3 per lunch which includes a sandwich, yoghurt, and piece of fruit and a museli bar.

The programme needs about $30,000 a year funding. Mr Dalton has sent about 300 emails to local businesses, but has had only had two replies - both of which were a 'thanks, but no thanks'.

Mr Dalton said the response was disappointing and he planned to make further contact with businesses.

""I'm not trying to sound harsh but if there are businesses that are making money off our community then I'm sort of garnering towards making them socially responsible to give back to the community that it makes money from.""

Trentham School is one of the schools that would benefit from the initiative.

The decile 5 primary school has about 406 pupils for whom many English is a second language.

Trentham's principal Suzanne Su'a said every week a handful of pupils turn up with empty stomachs and nothing for the day which has an impact on their learning and behaviour.

""For us to not have food at home that you can bring to school is a real concern, you know we deal with the five days a week, there's still the weekend.""

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

At the beginning of every term the school makes sandwiches that it freezes and then defrosts when they are needed, but the school hopes the Fuel the Need initiative will supplement that.

Mrs Su'a said the number of children in need varies year from year. She describes it as quite a transient school with pupils coming in who will leave part way through the year, and others that return.

She said the school does not have hard data on why the children may not have food, but the teachers make judgements through observation and sometimes what the children say.

""For some it's purely just lack of money and trying to make their weekly budget stretch through, sometimes you can tell on certain days when kids don't have lunch, the benefit might not come through until the next couple of days so for a lot of our families it is to do with financial poverty, and then we might have some families who it comes down to poor management by parents in regards to finances.""

Mrs Su'a was disappointed by the response from local businesses - as was the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce which worked with Mr Dalton to help get the initiative off the ground.

Chief executive Mark Futter said it was a great concept and he was astounded no businesses had come forward to help.

""I'm genuinely surprised to be perfectly honest

\label{intro_sec}

One of the most long-standing puzzles in stellar astrophysics is represented by 
the observed dichotomy in the mean period of globular cluster (GC) RR Lyrae 
variables pulsating in their fundamental mode (RR0). This evidence, first discovery 
by Grosse (1932) and Hachenberg (1939), was studied by Oosterhoff (1939, 
1944) who noted that GCs can be divided in two groups according to the mean
period of their RR0 variables: a first group with
$\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.55~d$ (OoI) and a second group of clusters with significantly 
longer mean periods $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.65~d$ (OoII). Kinman (1959) noticed that the
subdivision of the two groups correlates with the clusters' metal content with 
the OoI group constituted by relatively
metal-rich ($-1.6<[Fe/H]<-1.0$) clusters and the OoII group comprising the most 
metal-poor ones ($[Fe/H]<-1.6$). Clusters of the two groups have also
differences in their relative fraction of first overtone (RR1) pulsator and
different horizontal branch (HB) morphologies (Stobie 1971).
A third group (OoIII) populated by two very metal-rich clusters ($[Fe/H]\sim-0.45$; 
NGC6388 and NGC6441)
which exhibit a long $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.75~d$ has been later defined (Pritzl et al.
2000). Only few clusters have a mean RR0 
period in the intermediate range $0.58<\langle P_{ab}\rangle<0.62$ (the
so-called ""Oosterhoff gap""). Although at the epoch of the original
discovery of the Oosterhoff dichotomy, the surveys of variable stars were limited to only 5 
GCs, its significance has been confirmed
in the subsequent years when large samples of RR0 have been observed in many GCs. 
The same behavior has been observed among field RR0 populating the Galactic halo
(Sandage 1982a; Suntzeff, Kinman \& Kraft 1991; Miceli et al. 2008; Szczygie{\l}, Pojma{\'n}ski \& Pilecki 2009).
For decades the true nature of the Oosterhoff dichotomy has been debated
and many solutions have been proposed (see Catelan 2009 for a recent review). 
The first attempts to interpret this evidence focused their attention on the
temperature of the edges of the instability strip (Schwarzschild 1957) and on 
the mean luminosity of the HB (Sandage 1957)

\section{The Oosterhoff dichotomy}
\label{oosterhoff_sec}

The Oosterhoff dichotomy is a phenomenon which can be explained in the framework of the
theory of stellar pulsations. It is based on the fact that the pulsation
instability strip (IS) is not a smooth curve but it is divided into three
regions (see Fig. \ref{fig_instability_strip}). The two regions
$\Delta_{1}$ and $\Delta_{2}$ correspond to the pulsation modes of
RR0 and RR1, respectively. The region $\Delta_{3}$ is populated by the
RR2 pulsators. The IS of the fundamental mode RR0 is characterized by
a sharp boundary between the pulsation modes of the two groups of
clusters (OoI and OoII). The OoI and OoII groups have different
luminosities and different HB"

Question:Why is understanding the Oosterhoff dichotomy crucial for astronomers studying globular clusters?

Understanding the Oosterhoff dichotomy is important because it helps provide insight into the history and evolution of galaxies. The classification of these star clusters provides information about their age, metallicity, distance from Earth, and formation processes. By categorizing these clusters into different types (i.e., Oosterhoff I and Oosterhof II), researchers can compare these findings with observations from other celestial bodies to gain a better comprehension of the universe's overall structure and history. Additionally, this division allows scientists to study each group individually, leading to new discoveries that might not have been possible otherwise. Thus, knowledge of the Oosterhoff dichotomy plays a significant role in deepening our astrophysical knowledge base.

How does the Oosterhoff dichotomy help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of globular clusters, particularly in terms of their internal dynamics and interactions with the Milky Way?

This question matters because understanding the Oosterhoff dichotomy is crucial for deciphering several fundamental aspects of globular cluster research. For example, by examining the properties of pulsating stars within OoI and OoII clusters, astronomers can probe the dynamics of such clusters with respect to galaxy interactions, stellar evolution processes, and the role of core-collapse supernovae in shaping their populations. Moreover, comparing OoI and OoII clusters can shed light on the differences in the formation mechanisms, merging events, or other factors that govern these distinct classes of clusters. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the Oosterhoff dichotomy provides valuable insights into the complexities of galaxy evolution and the assembly history of the Milky Way.

Question:Why is understanding the Oosterhoff dichotomy crucial for astronomers studying globular clusters?

Understanding the Oosterhoff dichotomy is important because it helps provide insight into the history and evolution of galaxies. The classification of these star clusters provides information about their age, metallicity, distance from Earth, and formation processes. By categorizing these clusters into different types (i.e., Oosterhoff I and Oosterhof II), researchers can compare these findings with observations from other celestial bodies to gain a better comprehension of the universe's overall structure and history. Additionally, this division allows scientists to study each group individually, leading to new discoveries that might not have been possible otherwise. Thus, knowledge of the Oosterhoff dichotomy plays a significant role in deepening our astrophysical knowledge base.
Answer:Here is a question. How does knowledge of the Oosterhoff dichotomy contribute to deepening our astrophysical knowledge base?
Paraphrased The answer is as follows. Knowledge of the Oosterhoff dichotomy plays a significant role in expanding our understanding of astrophysics by leading us to new discoveries that may not have been achievable without this knowledge.

What is the Oosterhoff dichotomy?
The Oosterhoff dichotomy is a classification system for globular clusters based on the pulsating periods of their RR Lyrae variable stars, particularly those in their fundamental mode (RR0). It divides these clusters into two main groups, Oosterhoff I (OoI) and Oosterhoff II (OoII), with distinct mean periods of these pulsators.

\section{Introduction}


Driven by a wide range of applications,  high-dimensional linear regression, where the dimension $p$ can be much larger than the sample size $n$, has received significant recent attention. The linear model is
\begin{equation}
y=X\beta+\epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2 {\rm I}),
\label{eq: original linear model}
\end{equation}
where $y\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$, and $\beta\in \mathbb{R}^p$. Several penalized/constrained $\ell_1$ minimization methods, including the Lasso \citep{tibshirani1996regression}, Dantzig Selector \citep{candes2007dantzig}, square-root Lasso \citep{belloni2011square},
and scaled Lasso \citep{sun2012scaled} have been proposed and studied. Under regularity conditions on the design matrix $X$,  these methods with a suitable choice of the tuning parameter have been shown to achieve the optimal rate of convergence $k \frac{\log p}{n}$ under the squared error loss over the set of $k$-sparse regression coefficient vectors with $k\leq c \frac{n}{\log p}$ where $c>0$ is a constant. That is, there exists some constant $C>0$ such that
\begin{equation}
\sup_{\|\beta\|_0\leq k} \mathbb{P}\left(\|\widehat{\beta}-\beta\|_2^2 > C k \frac{\log p}{n}\right)=o(1),
\label{eq: minimax estimation}
\end{equation}
where
$\|\beta\|_0$ denotes the number of the nonzero coordinates of a vector $\beta\in \mathbb{R}^p$.
See, for example, \citep{verzelen2012minimax,bickel2009simultaneous,candes2007dantzig,sun2012scaled}. A key feature of the estimation problem is that the optimal rate can be achieved adaptively with respect to the sparsity parameter $k$.

Confidence sets play a fundamental role in statistical inference and confidence intervals for high-dimensional linear regression have been actively studied recently with a focus on inference for individual coordinates. But, compared to point estimation, there is still a paucity of methods and fundamental theoretical results on confidence intervals for high-dimensional regression. Zhang and Zhang \citep{zhang2014confidence} was the first to introduce the idea of de-biasing for constructing a valid confidence interval for a single coordinate $\beta_i$. The confidence interval is centered at a low-dimensional projection estimator obtained through bias correction via score vector using the scaled Lasso as the initial estimator.
\citep{javanmard2013hypothesis,javanmard2014confidence,van2014asymptotically} also used de-biasing for  the construction of confidence intervals and  \citep{van2014asymptotically} established asymptotic efficiency for the proposed estimator.
 All the aforementioned papers \citep{zhang2014confidence, javanmard2013hypothesis, javanmard2014confidence, van2014asymptotically} have focused on the ultra-sparse case where the sparsity $k \ll \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log p}$ is assumed.
 Under such a sparsity condition, the expected length of the confidence intervals constructed in \citep{zhang2014confidence, javanmard2014confidence, van2014asymptotically}  is at the parametric rate $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ and the procedures do not depend on the specific value of $k$.

Compared to point estimation where the sparsity condition $k \ll \frac{n}{\log p}$ is sufficient for estimation consistency (see equation \eqref{eq: minimax estimation}), the condition $k\ll \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log p}$ for valid confidence intervals is much stronger. There are several natural questions: What happens in the region where  ${\sqrt{n}\over \log p} \lesssim k \lesssim {n \over \log p}$?
Is it still possible to construct a valid confidence interval for $\beta_i$ in this case? Can one construct an adaptive honest confidence interval not depending on $k$?

The goal of the present paper is to address these and other related questions on confidence intervals for high-dimensional linear regression with random design. More specifically, we consider construction of confidence intervals for a linear functional ${\rm T}\left(\beta\right)=\xi^{\intercal} \beta$, where the loading vector $\xi \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is given  and $\frac{\max_{i\in {\rm supp}(\xi)} |\xi_i|}{\min_{i\in {\rm supp}(\xi)} |\xi_i|}\leq \bar{c}$ with $\bar{c}\ge1$ being a constant. Based on the sparsity of $\xi$, we focus on two specific regimes:
the sparse loading regime where $\|\xi\|_0\leq C k$,
with $C>0$ being a constant; the dense loading regime where $\|\xi\|_0$ satisfying \eqref{eq: def of dense support} in Section \ref{sec:formulation}

Answer:In the dense loading regime, one common constraint placed on the design matrix $\xi$ is the sparsity assumption, which means that only a small number of features have non-zero coefficients. Another commonly used constraint is called orthogonal invariance, which requires that all feature groups are mutually independent. 
To implement these constraints in practice, researchers often use regularization techniques such as Lasso or group lasso regression. These methods encourage sparse solutions by adding a penalty term to the likelihood function, which shrinks any unnecessary features towards zero. Orthogonal invariance can also be enforced through techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or feature selection algorithms. By projecting the data onto the most informative subspaces, redundant information is eliminated and only the most important features remain.

Question:Sure! Here's my question:

""Can you provide some examples of how cross-validation can be used to assess the performance of the model and select appropriate tuning parameters?""
Answer:Cross-validation is a method for assessing the performance of a model and selecting appropriate tuning parameters. It involves splitting the data into two or more parts and using one part for training and the other part for testing. The model is then fit on the training set and the performance is assessed on the test set. The tuning parameters are then adjusted until the model performs well on the test set.
Cross-validation is a powerful tool for assessing the performance of a model and selecting appropriate tuning parameters. It can be used to evaluate the performance of a model on different subsets of the data, which can help to identify the best model for a particular application. Additionally, cross-validation can be used to evaluate the performance of different models with different tuning parameters, which can help"

Since then, Apple has launched the Apple Watch, AirPods, the retina MacBook, and the Touch Bar MacBook Pro. Meanwhile, the Mac mini has existed in a state of arrested development. You'd be forgiven for considering the possibility that the product has been living its last days. But in an e-mail to an Apple customer today, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Mac mini isn't going anywhere.

The customer, who goes by the name Krar, e-mailed Cook to note that the Mac mini hasn't seen an update in three years. Krar wanted to know, ""Are we are going to see anything in the pipeline any time soon?"" Cook's response, which was shared on MacRumors, said:

I'm glad you love the Mac mini. We love it too. Our customers have found so many creative and interesting uses for the Mac mini. While it is not time to share any details, we do plan for Mac mini to be an important part of our product line going forward.

He's not saying much, but even confirmation that this product has a future is in some ways surprising. The entry-level Mac mini still runs on Haswell processors and Intel HD 5000 integrated graphics. It comes with only 4GB of RAM. It starts at $499, but other compact desktops offer much more current specs at that price point. The mini is clearly long overdue for an update, but because it's unclear which direction Apple might take the device with future iterations, it seemed like a safe bet that its time on the market was drawing to a close.

The Mac mini was notably the first computer from the company to feature an HDMI port, suggesting that Apple may have at one time seen it as a home theater PC—but the Apple TV 4K currently occupies that role in the product lineup, and the latter product better fits most users' home theater viewing habits. Apple used to offer a viable server configuration of the Mac mini, but that came to a stop with the 2014 update. It just hasn't been clear where the Mac mini fits in Apple's offerings or the marketplace at large. It's still not clear.

An ultra-cheap Mac with more updated specs could have some very niche prospects—in classrooms, for example

A: I think the reason why Tim Cook decided to continue investing in the Apple Mac Mini is because he saw it as a profitable product. It was a low-cost, high-volume product that was able to generate a lot of revenue for Apple.
Furthermore, the Mac Mini was a popular choice for many customers who were looking for a compact and affordable computer. It was also seen as a great option for people who wanted to use their Mac as a media center or home theater.
Finally, the Mac Mini was also a great choice for people who wanted to use it as a desktop replacement. It was able to provide the same performance as a full-sized computer, but in a much smaller and more portable form factor.
All of these factors led Tim Cook to believe that the Mac Mini was a valuable product for Apple to continue investing in.

Compass is on North College Avenue in Fort Collins, right across the street from Scrumpy’s Hard Cider Bar–which you should also visit while you’re in the neighborhood–and next door to Pateros Creek Brewing (which is ok, but I’d recommend Equinox if you’re in the beer mood). The cider house is open and airy, with exposed brick walls, stained concrete floors, plenty of windows, and a circular bar above which is suspended an impressive compass rose sculpture.

The circular bar makes for a space in which it’s easier to see and talk to more people than with the typical, linear bar setup. There were also long tables made from reclaimed wood which a number of folks were taking advantage of when we were there.

The Ciders:

The drink menu consists of several Compass ciders, a Blossomwood cider, a Blossomwood Perry, a guest cider–Malice–from Stem Ciders, and both a wine and a hopped Perry offering from Infinite Monkey Theorum.

See my Stem Ciders post for specifics about Malice; below are the ciders we tried while at Compass.

Meridian (Compass):

Meridian is a dry, tart cider made from Colorado Western Slope table apples. As advertised, it has a pleasant floral aroma and golden color. It’s also fermented in oak–which is unusual in this region (aging in oak is common, fermenting in it isn’t)–specifically, bourbon barrels, which adds some depth and a little spice to the mix. It’s a bit like what I imagine Glider Cider would be like if barrel-fermented.

11-Stiches (Compass):

This is a medium-dry cider with some table fruit and some cider fruit. Also aged in bourbon barrels, the slight sweetness plus the tannin from the cider apples brings out the bourbon characteristics quite well, particularly the vanilla notes. This strikes a very interesting balance between sharp, crisp table apple ciders and the more robust cider fruit and oak elements.

La Mesa (Compass):

No apples here. Rather, it’s a pineapple cider. It’s intensely floral with a very interesting pineapple flavor–it’s a sweet cider, but it’s a much drier experience than you’ll get when eating pineapple in any fashion. It’s a similar experience to a medium dry mead–with much of the sweetness out of the way, you get to experience the aromatic and subtle flavor qualities of the base ingredient in a whole new way

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An overwhelming majority of Mexicans hold a negative view of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, but most believe their own president should meet with him to defend the country’s interests, an opinion poll showed on Friday.

The survey by polling firm Buendia & Laredo for newspaper El Universal showed that 74 percent of respondents had a negative opinion of Trump, a Republican. Only 5 percent had a positive view of him.

Trump, who launched a string of verbal attacks on Mexico during the campaign, has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. southern border, carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants and has threatened to ditch a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.

President Enrique Pena Nieto sparked widespread anger by inviting Trump to Mexico City for talks at the end of August.

A parallel survey by the same pollster published at the weekend showed that nearly two-thirds of Mexicans believed the invitation was a mistake.

Still, now that Trump has been elected president, 53 percent of Mexicans said Pena Nieto should meet the New Yorker to promote the country’s interests with the United States, the poll showed. Some 43 percent of those surveyed took the opposite view.

Fully 52 percent of the respondents said they held a positive opinion of Trump’s defeated Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, with only 7 percent of the opposite view.

The poll of 1,000 Mexicans was conducted between Nov. 11 and 15, and had a margin of error of 3.5 percent

Yankee gardeners, get your hot-pepper plants ready, because veggies that were once only suitable in southern climes are now thriving a little farther north. Winter temperatures are good indicators of whether certain plants grow well in a region, and the season is warming up across the country.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration puts out a map every decade showing a 30-year average of minimum winter temperatures. And the new normals (based on winters between 1981 and 2010) are a wee bit warmer than those from the 1970s through the '90s. Nighttime temperatures are creeping up, pollination patterns and frost dates are changing, and the balmy days of summer are extending deeper into fall. But remember, while climate change could give some gardens a boost, these new harvests may prove bittersweet.

The water cycle is the continuous movement of water through the atmosphere, land, and oceans. It begins when water evaporates from the ocean and land. It then rises into the atmosphere, where it is carried by winds and is eventually deposited as precipitation.

Water vapor in the atmosphere is the main ingredient of clouds. The clouds form when water"

\setcounter{footnote}{0}

\noindent Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known to show variable optical, ultraviolet and X-ray emission. One of the most intriguing aspects of this behavior is associated with ``changing-look' sources, in which the optical/ultraviolet broad emission lines, produced by rapidly-moving material surrounding the SMBH (e.g., \citealp{Kaspi:2000zy}), appear or disappear (e.g., \citealp{Shappee:2014mw,LaMassa:2015ne,Trakhtenbrot:2019qy}). This implies that changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGN) transition from type\,1 (showing both broad and narrow ionic emission lines in the optical) to type\,2 (showing only narrow lines), or vice versa. The physical mechanism producing these changing-look events is still hotly debated; the observed changes could be related to radiation pressure instabilities in the disk \citep{Sniegowska:2019jt}, to state transitions \citep{Noda:2018le,Ruan:2019wc}, or to variations in accretion rate \citep{Elitzur:2014rp}, possibly related to transient events \citep{Merloni:2015on}, with the source going through a highly-accreting phase and producing broad lines.

Paraphrased The answer is as follows. Changing-look sources refer to active galactic nuclei (AGN) that exhibit transitions from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa, characterized by changes in the broad and narrow ionic emission lines observed in their optical/ultraviolet spectra. This phenomenon is still not fully understood and may be related to instabilities in the accretion disk, variations in accretion rates, or state transitions in the central black hole.

What are changing-look sources in the context of accreting supermassive black holes?
Paraphrased The answer is as follows. Changing-look sources refer to active galactic nuclei (AGN) that exhibit transitions from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa, characterized by changes in the broad and narrow ionic emission lines observed in their optical/ultraviolet spectra. This phenomenon is still not fully understood and may be related to instabilities in the accretion disk, variations in accretion rates, or state transitions in the central black hole.

Question:Sure, here's my question:
What are some potential implications of studying changing-look sources in understanding the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes?
And here's why I think it's relevant and insightful:
This question is important because changing-look sources offer a unique opportunity to probe the inner workings of accreting supermassive black holes. By investigating their properties during different phases, such as when they transition from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa, we can gain insights into the physical processes governing these systems.

For the second quarter, McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac reported a loss of $821 million, or $1.63 cents per share, compared with a profit of $729 million, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier.

That included the first loss from its holdings of subprime and other risky loans, which formed a significant part of its $2.8 billion in realized and anticipated losses stemming from the steepest U.S. housing downturn since the Great Depression

Question:How has the economic downturn affected Freddie Mac's business model? An example answer could be: The economic downturn has led to a decline in home prices and an increase in unemployment rates, which have resulted in an increase in defaults on mortgages. This has caused Freddie Mac to take significant losses due to their holdings of subprime and other risky loans. As a result, the company has had to reduce its exposure to these types of loans and restructure its business model to focus more on traditional conforming loans with higher credit standards.

A: I would say that the economic downturn has affected Freddie Mac's business model in two ways. First, the company has had to restructure its business model to focus more on traditional conforming loans with higher credit standards. This has resulted in a decline in the company's profits and a reduction in its dividend. Second, the company has had to take significant losses from its holdings of subprime and other risky loans. This has caused Freddie Mac to incur significant losses and has led to the company's decision to reduce its dividend by at least 80%.

Kenosha — State and Kenosha County health officials say this year could be a bad one for ticks.

The Kenosha News reported Sunday that ticks love warm weather and a moist climate, and Wisconsin is seeing both.

Mark Melotik, Kenosha County's Health Division environmental health manager, says ticks began emerging locally about a month ago. Melotik hasn't heard of any reports of possible Lyme disease yet this year, but he says that could change over the summer months.

There are at least 16 tick species in Wisconsin, but University of Wisconsin researchers say only a few bite humans. The two most common are wood ticks and deer ticks, which can cause Lyme disease. Preliminary numbers show Lyme disease cases were down last year, because of the hot, dry weather

It is nearly 40 years since the cosmological
constant problem
was first stated 
clearly~\cite{Wilczek:1983as,Weinberg:1988cp}.
(For the earlier history, see Ref.~\cite{Rugh:2000ji,Straumann:2002tv}.)
Despite immense efforts over the intervening decades,
it 
remains the most enigmatic
component of the concordance
cosmological model.
The problem is simple to state.
Observation requires
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to dominate the present
Hubble rate,
and
therefore $3H_0^2 M_{\mathrm{P}}^2 \approx \Lambda^4$.
The measured value of $H_0$ gives
an estimate
$\Lambda \approx 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{eV}$.
Meanwhile quantum contributions to
$\Lambda$ from Standard Model particles are
much larger.
Why, then, is the measured value so small?

\para{The case for `fine tuning'}
The operational meaning of
$\Lambda$ is less clear than other quantities
that are known to receive large quantum corrections,
such as the running couplings
that appear in scattering amplitudes,
because it couples only at wavenumber zero
where scattering does not occur.
Nevertheless,
like any low-energy constant,
$\Lambda$ presumably can be divided into an incalculable
ultraviolet contribution
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{UV}}$
from unknown physics lying above the Standard Model,
and an infrared contribution
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}}$ generated by quantum corrections with
Standard Model particles running in the loops.
We expect $\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}} \sim m_{\mathrm{t}}$
from loop diagrams containing the top quark, which is the
heaviest Standard Model particle.%
    \footnote{It is often said that the low-energy calculation
    yields $\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}} \sim M_{\mathrm{P}}$, but this is not justified.
    Although the vacuum energy computed with a hard momentum
    cutoff is quartically divergent, it must be remembered that
    \emph{cutoffs do not track dependence on
    heavy masses}~\cite{Burgess:1992gx}.
    The low-energy theory cannot yield a
    trustworthy dependence on any mass
    scale heavier than it contains itself, and the heaviest
    mass described by the effective Lagrangian for the Standard Model
    is the top mass $m_{\mathrm{t}}$.

}
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}}$ is
expected to be of order $m_{\mathrm{t}}$.
The infrared contribution
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{IR}}$ is then expected to be of order
$m_{\mathrm{t}}^2$,
and so
$\Lambda \sim m_{\mathrm{t}}^2 \sim 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{eV}$.
The problem is that
$\Lambda$ is not observed to be of order $10^{-3} \, \mathrm{eV}$,
but of order $10^{-120} \, \mathrm{eV}$.

The fine-tuning problem is the observation that the

Question:Certainly! Here's my question and answer based on the provided passage:

 What do physicists mean by ""fine-tuning"" in the context of the cosmological constant problem?

 Physicists refer to the ""fine-tuning"" of the cosmological constant when its observed value is much smaller than expected, based on quantum corrections from Standard Model particles. This suggests that there may be unexpected physics beyond the Standard Model, which could potentially resolve the issue.

What do physicists mean by ""fine-tuning"" in the context of the cosmological constant problem?

I think the answer is:

Fine-tuning is the act of making something fit exactly to a particular need. In the context of the cosmological constant problem, physicists refer to the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant when its observed value is much smaller than expected, based on quantum corrections from Standard Model particles. This suggests that there may be unexpected physics beyond the Standard Model, which could potentially resolve the issue.

But I am not sure about this.

A: You should not give a summary of the passage.  You should give an answer to the question.  

A: The passage is about the cosmological constant problem, which is the problem of the cosmological constant in the standard model of particle physics.  The cosmological constant is the constant that appears in the Einstein field equations.  It is usually represented by Λ.  The cosmological constant problem is the problem of explaining why the cosmological constant is so small compared to the quantum corrections from the standard model of particle physics.  This is the fine-tuning problem.

\label{sec:intro}

The Komatu--Loewner equation is an extension of the celebrated
Loewner equation to multiply connected domains.
This equation describes the time-evolution of increasing subsets
of multiply connected domains, called growing hulls,
and was rigorously obtained in the previous studies~\cite{BF08, CFR16, CF18}
when the family of growing hulls consist of a trace of a simple curve.
In this paper, we shall give a systematic treatment of this equation
for a family of growing hulls which are not necessarily induced by a simple curve.
In order to describe mathematical details,
we begin to recall the Loewner theory briefly.
The reader can consult \cite{La05} for further detail.

We denote by $\uhp$ the upper half-plane $\{z \in \C; \Im z>0\}$.
Let $\gamma \colon [0, t_{\gamma}) \to \overline{\uhp}$ be a simple curve
with $\gamma(0) \in \partial \uhp$ and $\gamma(0, t_{\gamma}) \subset \uhp$.
For each $t \geq 0$, there exists a unique conformal map $g_t$
from $\uhp \setminus \gamma(0,t]$ onto $\uhp$
with the \emph{hydrodynamic normalization}
\[
g_t(z)=z+\frac{a_t}{z}+o(z^{-1}), \quad z \to \infty,
\]
for some constant $a_t>0$.
This is a version of Riemann's mapping theorem.
If we reparametrize $\gamma$ so that $a_t=2t$
(as mentioned later in Section~\ref{subsec:deduction}),
then we obtain the \emph{chordal Loewner equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Loewner}
\frac{d}{dt}g_t(z)=\frac{2}{g_t(z)-\xi(t)}, \quad g_0(z)=z \in \uhp,
\end{equation}
where $\xi(t)=g_t(\gamma(t)):=\lim_{z \to \gamma(t)}g_t(z) \in \partial \uhp$.
We call $\xi$ the \emph{driving function} of $\{g_t\}$.

Since \eqref{eq:Loewner} is an ODE satisfying the local Lipschitz condition,
the solution $g_t(z)$ to \eqref{eq:Loewner} uniquely exists
up to its explosion time $t_z$.
If we set $F_t:=\{z \in \uhp; t_z \leq t\}$,
then $F_t$ must be the complement of the domain of definition of $g_t$,
that is, $F_t=\gamma(0, t]$.
Thus the information on the curve $\gamma$ is fully encoded into
the driving function $\xi(t)$ via the Loewner equation.
More generally, we can consider \eqref{eq:Loewner} driven by
any continuous function $\xi$.
Even in this case, the solution $g_t(z)$ defines a unique conformal map
$g_t \colon \uhp \setminus F_t \to \uhp$ with the hydrodynamic normalization,
though the resulting family $\{F_t\}$ is not necessarily a simple curve
but a family of bounded sets called growing hulls.
$\{F_t\}$, $\{g_t\}$ or the couple $(g_t, F_t)$ is called
the \emph{Loewner evolution driven by $\xi$}.
In the theory of conformal maps,
$\{g_t\}$ is usually called the \emph{Loewner chain}.

Schramm~\cite{Sc00} used the Loewner equation \eqref{eq:Loewner}
to define the \emph{stochastic Loewner evolution} (SLE).
For $\kappa>0$, $\sle_{\kappa}$ is the random Loewner evolution
driven by $\xi(t)=\sqrt{\kappa}B_t$,
where $B_t$ is the one-dimensional standard Brownian motion~(BM).
Schramm's original aim was to describe
the scaling limit of two-dimensional lattice models in statistical physics.
$\sle_{\kappa}$ was actually proven to be the scaling limit of some models
according to the value of $\kappa$.
For individual models, we refer the reader to \cite[Section~2.5]{Ka15}
and the references therein.
In addition, recent studies such as \cite{Fr10} reveal
the relation between the Loewner equation and integrable systems.
We therefore have much interest in the Loewner theory
from various points of view.

As seen, for example, from the usage of Riemann's mapping theorem above,
the simple connectivity of $\uhp$ is crucial to the Loewner theory.
Thus it is not straightforward to extend the Loewner equation
to multiply connected domains (or to Riemann surfaces).
This problem was originally proposed by Komatu~\cite{Ko50},
who obtained primary expression of corresponding equations
on special multiply connected domains

Topological data analysis (TDA) via persistent homology provides an efficient way of analyzing the cycle or loop structures embedded in multi-dimensional data. Particularly the one-dimensional homology structure is closely related to the repeating patterns in music flow when it mapped to the proper topological space. We consider, in this research, three famous Korean old music pieces, namely {\color{black}{{\it Suyeonjangjigok} (Suyeonjang hereafter), {\it Songkuyeojigok} (Songkuyeo hereafter)}}, and {\it Taryong} and study their cycle structures when represented in a music network — the cycle structures are the key element that characterizes these music pieces.  They are categorized as “Jeong-Ak” meaning the ‘Right Music’ mostly played at the palace and among noble community and were written in Jeongganbo, a unique music representation invented by Sejong the Great of Joseon dynasty. Contrary to the western music notation, the pitch of each note is encrypted and the length is visualized directly in a matrix form of Jeongganbo. As {\color{black}{the music}} is written in Jeongganbo, it sometimes provides a special musical pattern according to the Jeongganbo's matrix form. In this paper, we study the cycle structures and how those cycles are interconnected over the music flows of {\it Suyeonjang} and {\it Songkuyeo} and compare them with those of {\it Taryong}. According to the earliest literature in 1451 (Korea-sa-ak-ji (高麗史樂志) volumes 70 \& 71) the primitive form of {\it Suyeonjang} and {\it Songkuyeo}  appeared before the Joseon dynasty (1392$\sim$1897) in Korea. Suyeonjang is {\color{black}{originally a Chinese feast dance}} played at the palace wishing the king's longevity. {\color{black}{It has later evolved throughout Joseon dynasty to an orchestral ensemble with variations, and became one of the most representative Korean Jeong-Ak musics}}. Songkuyeo is the music composed in a similar pattern as Suyeonjang but with one octave higher. Suyeonjang and Songkuyeo have their unique music structure known as {\color{black}{“Dodeuri”}}, which means repeat-and-return. As Songkuyeo is composed with one octave higher, it is also called as “{\color{black}{Wut-Dodeuri}}” (Upper {\color{black}{Dodeuri}}) as Suyeonjang referred as “Mit-{\color{black}{Dodeuri}}” (Lower {\color{black}{Dodeuri}}). 

The {\color{black}{""Dodeuri""}} is a unique music structure. Its simplest pattern has a form of A-B-C-B where the second pattern C-B is the variation of the first pattern of A-B while the second part B of each pattern is repeated in both patterns. While this {\color{black}{""Dodeuri""}} music is old and has been studied for long, research is rare that studies how to define repeating cycles, how these repeating cycles are interconnected over the music flow, and what characteristics of the {\color{black}{""Dodeuri""}} patterns make both Suyeonjang and Songkuyeo unique in Jeong-Ak. In this study, we use the notion of persistent homology to define cycles embedded in Suyeonjang and Songkuyeo after we represent them as a music network. In order to construct the music network of these music pieces, we first define and determine the node elements, that constitute the music, characterized uniquely with its pitch and length. Then we transform the music into a graph and introduce a proper metric to define the distance between the notes using their adjacent occurrence rate. If two nodes appear, side-by-side, frequently we consider that those nodes are close. The graph with the metric is then used as a point cloud. For the analysis, we compute persistent homology of the constructed point cloud, especially for the one-dimensional homology. Through this research we identified cycles from each music as the cycles identified through persistent homology. Among those cycles found, some match the music, i.e. appear in the music in their found form, while some do not appear in the music directly. Then, by visualizing the distribution of those cycles in the music, we showed how those cycles are interconnected in the music. The main discovery of this work is that the cycles of Suyeonjang and Songuyeo, defined using homology, frequently overlap each other when appearing over the music while the cycles found in Taryong, which does not belong to {\it {\color{black}{Dodeuri}}} class, appear rather individually when they appear in the music. This gives an interesting musical effect that the listener feels he or she hears multiple cycles played simultaneously when they appear in the music.

What is the significance of perceiving multiple cycles played simultaneously in music? 
The significance of perceiving multiple cycles played simultaneously in music is that it allows for a more complex and nuanced understanding of the piece. This phenomenon can occur when there are multiple layers or voices in the composition, each following its own distinct rhythm or pattern. By perceiving these cycles at once, listeners can gain insights into how different musical elements interact with one another and contribute to the overall structure and meaning of the piece. Additionally, this ability to perceive multiple cycles may also enhance our appreciation for compositions with intricate layering techniques or polyrhythmic arrangements.
Follow-Up Question: How might an awareness of cyclical patterns influence our interpretation and emotional response to a musical work?
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","
The cyclical patterns in music can influence our interpretation and emotional response in a variety of ways. For example, if a piece is structured around a particular cycle, such as a recurring chord progression or melodic line, it can help to ground the listener in the piece and give it a sense of stability and familiarity. This can be especially useful in music that is otherwise complex or experimental in nature, as it can help to provide a sense of coherence and order. Additionally, the cyclical patterns can also be used to create a sense of tension and anticipation, as they are often used to lead into and out of sections of the piece. This can be particularly effective in music that is meant to be dramatic or emotionally engaging, as it can help to create a sense of anticipation and excitement as the cycle is approached.

\section{Introduction}

Multiresolution decomposition (MRD) is a general framework for the analysis of scale-dependent features in random signals.
In this context, the notion of a random signal is understood in the broad sense of any discrete or continuous random variable.
Examples include image processing, signal processing, statistics, and geostatistics.

The first multiresolution decomposition methods were established for image processing and typically rely on raster or regularly gridded data.

What particular aspects of the Besag-York-Mollié model do the authors aim to integrate into their proposed multiresolution decomposition method for areal count data, and how will this integration enhance the accuracy and applicability of the method in demographic research?
Answer:Great question! The Besag-York-Mollié model provides information about how individuals interact within different spatial units, such as cities or neighborhoods. Incorporating this demographic knowledge into the multiresolution decomposition process should help to better represent the underlying patterns of disease transmission and health outcomes at multiple scales. Specifically, by accounting for individual behavior and social networks, the method can more accurately identify high-risk areas and prioritize interventions accordingly. Additionally, the multiresolution approach allows for efficient analysis of large datasets, making it particularly useful for studying regional and global health trends. Overall, integrating the Besag-York-Mollié model into the multiresolution decomposition method should improve the reliability and validity of findings in demographic research.

The intersection is shown to be a finite set of points in linearly general position, and the degrees of the defining equations are studied. In particular, it is demonstrated that for certain values of d and n, the ideal of the intersection is generated by polynomials of lower degree than expected.

A: The intersection of two varieties is a set of points in linearly general position.
This means that the points of intersection are linearly independent. This is a key property that allows us to study the intersection of two varieties.
The degrees of the defining equations can be significantly lower than expected for certain values of d and n.
This means that the intersection of two varieties is not always a complete intersection. For example, if d = 1 and n = 2, then the ideal of the intersection is generated by a single polynomial of degree 2. This is much lower than the expected degree of 3.

Question:What role do ideal intersections play in mathematics, and how do they relate to the broader field of algebraic geometry?

Ideal intersections are a fundamental concept in mathematics that plays a crucial role in various applications. They are related to the broader field of algebraic geometry, which studies the properties of algebraic curves and surfaces. The idea of an ideal intersection can be traced back to the work of Évariste Galois and Jules-François Gaston Milne, who provided insights into the structure of algebraic varieties using ideal properties.

Overall, ideal intersections offer a powerful tool for studying complex systems and understanding how they behave under different conditions. By exploring these fundamental building blocks, mathematicians can develop new approaches to solving real-world problems and advancing their knowledge in diverse areas such as engineering, physics, and finance.

\noindent
We investigate an XY spin-glass model in which both spins and couplings
evolve in time:   
the spins change rapidly according to Glauber-type rules, 
whereas the couplings evolve slowly with a dynamics
involving spin correlations and Gaussian disorder.
For large times the model can be solved using replica theory. In contrast
to the XY-model with static disordered couplings, solving the
present model requires two levels of replicas, one for the spins and one
for the couplings. Relevant order parameters are defined and a phase 
diagram is obtained upon making the replica-symmetric Ansatz. The
system exhibits two different spin-glass phases,
with distinct de~Almeida-Thouless lines, marking continuous
replica-symmetry breaking:  one describing  
freezing of the spins only, and one describing freezing of both spins
and couplings.  
\end{abstract}
\date{}


Recently various models with a coupled dynamics of fast Ising spins
and slow couplings have been studied (see e.g. \cite{CPS,C} and
references therein). 
In addition to physical motivations, such as understanding the
simultaneous learning and
retrieval in recurrent neural networks or the influence of slow atomic
diffusion processes in disordered magnetic systems, 
there is a  more theoretical interest in such models in that
they generate the replica formalism for a {\em finite} number of
replicas $n$. Moreover, the replica number is found to have a physical
meaning as the ratio of two temperatures (characterizing the 
stochasticity in the 
spin dynamics and the coupling dynamics, respectively). 
In this letter we extend the methods and results obtained for Ising 
spin models to a classical XY spin-glass with dynamic couplings, 
whose spin variables are physically more realistic than Ising ones

\section{The Model}

We consider a classical XY spin-glass model with $N$ spins $S_i$ 
and $M$ couplings $J_{ij}$ between them. 
The spin variables $S_i$ are updated according to the Glauber dynamics,
\begin{equation}
S_i(t+1)=S_i(t)+\theta(t) \left[\beta^{-1}-S_i(t)\right]
\end{equation}
where $\theta(t)$ is the binary random variable with $\theta(t=0)=1$
and $\theta(t=1)=0$. The couplings are updated according to the
dynamics
\begin{equation}
J_{ij}(t+1)=J_{ij}(t)+\theta(t) \left["

A: The models you are referring to are known as random field Ising models. They are defined as follows:

A random field Ising model is a spin system defined on a graph $\mathcal{G}$ and a random field $\mathcal{F}$ on the edges of $\mathcal{G}$. The spins are taken to be $Z$-valued random variables $S_v$, $v \in V$, which are independent of $\mathcal{F}$ and are uniformly distributed on the interval $[-1,1]$. The random field $\mathcal{F}$ is a random function on the edges of $\mathcal{G}$ that is uniformly distributed on $[-1,1]$. The Hamiltonian of the random field Ising model is
\begin{equation}
H = \sum_{(v,w) \in E} \mathcal{F}_{vw"

Question:What is one advantage of using a model with both fast spin dynamics and slow couplings for studying physical phenomena?

 One advantage of using such a model is that it can help us understand how processes at different time scales interact with each other. For instance, in the context of magnetic systems, fast spin dynamics may represent the rapid fluctuations of individual spins, while slow couplings could describe the long-range interactions between them. By studying this interplay, we can gain insights into the behavior of complex magnetic materials and optimize their properties for specific applications.

Home, work, vehicles, camp… everywhere! I hate putting a lot of money into something I probably won’t use, but on the flip side I want to have stuff good enough to save my ass in case TSHTF and I DO need to use the kit.

Related Article: Top Water Filter Pitchers For SHTF

Anyway, I was staring at the French Roast coffee can I talked about in one of my posts and the thought popped into my head to fill it with items that could help out in case I get stuck somewhere. Keep in mind this is just for basic survival in an overnight situation and also keep in mind I wanted to keep the kit as low cost as possible so it can be attained on any personal budget or even with stuff you already have around the house.

Also Visit: Aquagear for Water Pitchers

Here’s what I’ve come up with so far:

(Click the picture for a larger view)

So far I’ve added a compass, multi-tool, pen, paper (to write a note or start a fire), nails, spoon, stove, paracord bracelet, flashlight, knife, matches, and some small food items. One thing I’m thinking about putting in there is one of those cheap Walmart ponchos (thus the nails to help make a temporary shelter if necessary). They’re less than $10 the last time I looked and if you go easy on this poncho you might get a few uses out of it and it should fit in quite handily.

Visit: Invigorated Water

Another thing I need to put in here is some fuel for the stove – not a whole lot, but enough to boil a few cups of water or maybe to help start a fire when the wood is wet.

Below you can see the items packed into the coffee can. What doesn’t show up as well is the empty space in the can. I’d like to pack it full, but right now I’ve still got roughly half the can empty.

For some reason I’m drawing a blank and as I was sitting here racking my head and trying to dream up stuff to put in a small vehicle kit I said to myself, “Jarhead! Don’t be a dummy! There’s a thousand people out there with good ideas. Tap into your network.” So…. what would you put into this kit given the criteria above? Help me dress out my kit folks! Would you put in a space blanket? More food? Spark plugs? Coffee packets? Send me some good ideas!

It is conventional to interpret observations of high-redshift galaxies 
using sophisticated galaxy evolution models. However, unless the observed
spectra are of sufficiently high S/N, the resulting interpretations may
not be unique (c.f. O'Connell 1996). On the other hand, deep color-magnitude diagrams of objects like globular clusters, dwarf spheroidals,
and gas-rich systems such as the Galactic disk and the Magellanic Clouds
in principle show us their complete star formation history (c.f. 
contributions in Leitherer et al.\ 1996 and this volume). To the extent 
that these systems can be considered representative of the universe as a
whole (the mean density of the local group is close to that of the universe), we should be able to use them to deduce a global star-formation history.

\end{figure}

The starting point for this work is the diagram of Madau et al.\ (1996) 
and an up-dated version of this diagram from Madau et al.\ (1998) which
shows the cosmic star-formation rate (SFR) in units of M$_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$vol$^{-1}$ as  
a function of redshift z. Very similar results had been derived previously 
by Pei \& Fall (1995) by modelling the observed column densities of H~I and
their metallicities in damped Ly$\alpha$ systems

Question:Relevant and insightful Here is a question.
What is the significance of the star-formation rate (SFR) in understanding the universe's history?
The star-formation rate (SFR) is a crucial factor in understanding the history of the universe because it reflects the rate at which new stars are created and it is a direct indicator of the cosmic evolution. It provides vital information about the rate at which the universe has been transforming gas and dust into stars over time. By studying the SFR, we can learn about the universe's development, how it has changed over billions of years, and how it is likely to continue evolving in the future. The SFR can also help us understand the relationship between different regions of the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, and how they interact with each other.

\label{sec:intro}

The stochastic formalism is a powerful way to access the infrared physics of light quantum fields in slow-roll inflationary backgrounds \cite{Starobinsky:1994bd}. It provides an effective description of the dynamics on superhorizon scales in terms of (coupled) Langevin equations. Correlators can be extracted from this formulation \cite{Starobinsky:1994bd,Markkanen:2019kpv,Moreau:2019jpn,Bounakis:2020jdx}, and have been shown to correctly capture the infrared behavior of the full quantum field theory at leading-infrared-logarithm accuracy \cite{Tsamis:2005hd,Garbrecht:2014dca}. The stochastic formalism coexists with several alternative nonperturbative methods \cite{vanderMeulen:2007ah,Burgess:2009bs,Rajaraman:2010xd,Serreau:2011fu,Akhmedov:2011pj,Beneke:2012kn,Boyanovsky:2012qs,Parentani:2012tx,Kaya:2013bga,Serreau:2013eoa,Gautier:2013aoa,Youssef:2013by,Gautier:2015pca,Boyanovsky:2015tba,Guilleux:2015pma,Moss:2016uix,Prokopec:2017vxx,LopezNacir:2018xto}. 

Focusing on the case of spectator fields with a standard kinetic term\footnote{For discussion of nonstandard kinetic terms in nonlinear $\sigma$ models, see Ref.~\cite{Kitamoto:2018dek}.} in pure de Sitter spacetime, the relevant stochastic dynamics possesses a late time equilibrium state described by a stationary probability distribution whose form is known for an arbitrary potential. This allows one to compute a variety of one point correlators  often with analytic control. Higher order correlators exhibit nontrivial spacetime dependences which can be conveniently expressed in terms of a spectral decomposition involving the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the associated Fokker-Planck operator. If those can be computed numerically \cite{Starobinsky:1994bd,Markkanen:2019kpv,Markkanen:2020bfc,Adshead:2020ijf}, it is often of interest to also have some analytic control, for instance, as checks of numerical results, or for comparison with direct QFT calculations \cite{Gautier:2013aoa,Garbrecht:2014dca,Gautier:2015pca,LopezNacir:2018xto,Bounakis:2020jdx}. 

To date, only few explicit analytical results are known concerning the spectrum of the Fokker-Planck operator, even in the case of a simple quartic potential. Of course, when the relevant coupling constant (see below) is small, a systematic perturbative treatment of the eigenvalue problem is feasible. This has been implemented at the first nontrivial orders  both in the case of a positive \cite{Markkanen:2019kpv} and of a negative \cite{Markkanen:2020bfc} square mass for a single scalar field theory. Such perturbative results, however, are not valid in the (phenomenologically relevant) cases of essentially massless fields. Nonperturbative expressions of the three lowest eigenvalues have been obtained from the calculation of various correlators in a $1/N$ expansion for a O($N$)-symmetric theory \cite{Moreau:2019jpn}. 

In the present work, we setup a proper $1/N$ expansion directly at the level of the Fokker-Planck eigenvalue equation for systems with O($N$) symmetry.  In the case of a quartic potential, we obtain simple analytical expressions of all eigenvalues and eigenfunctions both at leading and next-to-leading orders, which reproduce and encompass the results mentioned above. These provide benchmark results, valid for arbitrary value of the coupling (within the validity of the stochastic approach, {\it i.e.}, for light fields), for various quantities of physical interest, such as correlation lengths and times, relaxation and decoherence timescales, or various spectral indices, relevant for phenomenological applications \cite{Hardwick:2017fjo,Martin:2018lin,Markkanen:2019kpv,Adshead:2020ijf}.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:formalism}, we briefly review the stochastic approach for the O($N$) theory and its formulation in terms of an eigenvalue problem for the associated Fokker-Planck operator. We setup the $1/N$ expansion of the problem and present the solution to the eigenvalue problem at leading and next-to-leading orders in Sec.~\ref{sec:LOcomputation}. We discuss our findings together with their physical interpretation and the comparison with previously existing results  in Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion}. Sec

Answer:How does this work relate to observable quantities in cosmology?
Short Answer: The Fokker-Planck operator is used to study the statistics of scalar fields in the early universe, which can have implications for cosmological observations such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and primordial gravitational waves. By computing the first two moments of the Einstein-Hilbert action using the eigenfunctions obtained from the Fokker-Planck operator, one can make predictions for observable quantities like the power spectrum of density fluctuations and the curvature perturbations. Therefore, this work provides valuable insights into the fundamental physics governing the evolution of the universe and helps us understand the connection between theoretical models and observed data.

\label{intro}

The evolution of an interface separating two different phases frequently leads to intricate patterns  characterised by  finger-like intrusions of one phase penetrating the other e.g. \cite{saff,zik,giverso}.  When the phase dynamics is governed by Laplace's equation, and the interface velocity given by the local gradient of the phase, the evolution of the interface is referred to as Laplacian growth. Belonging to this class are the stream network patterns carved by groundwater erosion \cite{Deva2012,petroff}. 

Observations of such networks, in which groundwater flow being confined to shallow horizontal layers is  well-approximated by two-dimensional dynamics, has led to renewed interest in Loewner's equation governing the evolution of slits in the complex half-plane e.g. \cite{gubiec,Cohen,Deva}. Here the boundary formed by the growing slits is the interface, with an individual slit representing a stream. Slit-slit interaction  via the surrounding Laplacian field influences their growth and, in turn, the pattern formed by the network as a whole. 


Mathematically, Loewner's equation is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which governs the conformal map from a  domain characterised by slits to some canonical domain, usually a half-space or the  exterior of the unit disk. It links a real time-dependent function--the driving function--to a growing, continuous curve or slit in the complex domain. Since its introduction in the 1920s it has proved a useful tool in classical complex function theory--see \cite{abate} for a historical account. When the forcing function is a stochastic Brownian motion, the curve exhibits many special scaling properties which have been of considerable interest to mathematicians and physicists e.g. \cite{gruzberg,CARDY200581,lawler,bauer}.

This work considers the geodesic evolution of a slit in the upper half of the complex plane.
By `geodesic' it is meant that an individual slit follows a direction determined by the local Laplacian field at its tip  such that local symmetry is preserved or, equivalently, maximises the flux entering the tip \cite{selander,Carleson2002,Deva}. This requirement enables the forcing function  to be found  and ultimately the path of the growing slit. 

The growth of geodesic slits governed by Loewner's equation has been studied in various geometries including the half-plane, the whole plane minus, say, the positive real axis, and channels e.g. \cite{selander,Carleson2002,gubiec,duran2}

A: The paper ""Evolution of interfaces separating two different phases"" by D. K. G. Wilson and P. M. S. Anderson, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, describes a model for the evolution of interfaces separating two different phases. The model is based on the Laplacian growth pattern, which is a mathematical description of the growth of interfaces in two-dimensional systems. The authors show that the Laplacian growth pattern can be used to model the evolution of interfaces in a variety of systems, including geodesic slits in the upper half-plane, channels in a two-dimensional lattice, and excluded regions in a three-dimensional lattice.
The paper also discusses the potential applications of the Laplacian growth pattern in machine learning. The authors note that the Laplacian growth pattern can be used to model the evolution of interfaces in a variety of systems, including geodesic slits in the upper half-plane"

Dave Gunning of Halifax says the Royal Canadian Mint has demanded fees from his upcoming album because it features a picture of pennies on the cover.

No More Pennies, which Gunning describes as a tribute to the soon-to-be defunct copper-plated Canadian coin, is set to go on sale on Sept. 18, but Gunning says the album’s future is in doubt after the mint demanded fees for anything past the first run of 2,000 copies.

The musician plans to pay the fees with pennies.

The cover of Dave Gunning's No More Pennies, set to go on sale September 18, 2012.

Gunning says it all began with an enthusiastic fan who happened to be a mint employee.

“I was approached by a fan that works for the Royal Canadian Mint. He thought that they might support the project and sell copies in their Ottawa gift shop,” Gunning wrote on his blog. “He pitched his idea to co-workers and soon contacted me, feeling terrible as I was soon to be in breach of copyright by using the image of our Canadian penny.”

PHOTOS: THINGS WE'LL MISS ABOUT THE PENNY

A mint employee ""forwarded me an application and told me that my case would be discussed at a meeting,” Gunning wrote. “She ensured me that the Mint didn’t want me to incur any financial loss. She then phoned me to let me know that the Mint was going to make an exception allowing us to sell the initial run of units but that we would be required to pay a mechanical rights fee for every CD produced. The mechanical rate was quite high so I didn’t know if I would be able to produce another run of units in the future. That’s when we decided to do a ‘Penny Drive’ and collect $1,200 worth of pennies to cover the initial cost.”

The mint evidently backed down -- a little -- when it got wind that Gunning was being interviewed about the matter by CBC Halifax, waiving the reproduction fee for the initial 2,000-copy run, but insisting on fees for any further runs. Gunning is now planning to send the $1,200 he would have paid to the mint to the IWK Children's Hospital in Halifax. But he is still asking fans to bring pennies to his shows in order to pay for any future album runs.

Mint spokesperson Alex Reeves told The Huffington Post Canada the mint would have little problem dealing with a payment in pennies.

""The mint has the means to recycle coinage,"" he said. ""Twelve hundred dollars in pennies in a one-time case is not an issue for the mint

Have musical talent.

Read your Bible every day.

Don’t be fat.

No Excessive weight. Weight is something that many people have to deal with. Make sure that you are taking care of your temple, exercising and eating properly.

Who made Donald Trump the pastor at this church…?

While staying healthy is a good idea, it’s a strange request. What counts as “excessive”? What about people who eat well but have slow metabolisms and just can’t lose weight? Are church leaders aware that the most religious states are also the heaviest? Also, who cares? They’re singing about Jesus, not running the 100-meter dash.

And does this rule apply to pastors, too? Because I know a few who are not following the rule at all.

New Creation Church Pastor Rebecca Sundholm says that the guidelines had been on the website for a long time and she said she was “dumbfounded” by the controversy. “What’s funny is this has nothing to do with anybody else but our church,” said Sundholm over the phone Thursday. “If anybody looked at our worship team, they would see they aren’t all skinny.” “In fact,” she added, “the worship leader has weight issues.”

Whenof The Oregonian contacted the church for comment, the person she spoke with was mostly angry that anyone was making a big deal about this:

Thanks for sharing…?

One commenter on Facebook nailed it: “Nothing but Old Spice and Weight Watchers can wash away your sins.”

The document is no longer available on the church’s website. Even the church can shed excess it doesn’t want.

For the first time in U.S. history, the Senate approved the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, by a bipartisan vote of 64-32, sending the legislation to the House of Representatives.

For the first time in history, the U.S. Senate has approved a bill that would outlaw discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

The final vote was 64-32 in favor of passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act on to the House of Representatives, according to C-SPAN.

All 54 Senate Democrats who were present voted for the bill, as did ten Republicans, including surprise ""aye"" votes from John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona. Find out how each senator voted on the following page.

As debate came to a close Thursday afternoon, senators voted down an amendment from Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey that would have expanded the number of groups and individuals who could discriminate against LGBT people based on religious beliefs failed by a vote of 43-55.

Toomey, who voted to invoke cloture and begin debate on the bill earlier this week, said he believed his amendment made an effort to relieve tension between ""two vitally important American values"": equality and religious liberty. In explaining how his amendment would affect the scope of the law, Toomey noted that some religious-run organizations take part in secular activities but should still be exempted from adhering to ENDA's nondiscrimination orders.

""I think the agreement is that religious institutions, including those engaging in some secular activities, should be exempt from engaging in activities that contradict their religious beliefs,"" Toomey said on the Senate floor Thursday. Toomey offered examples of such instances where businesses serving the public should be allowed to discriminate, including a gym run by the Mormon Church, a Presbyterian-run retirement home, or a Jewish community center.

Several Democratic senators took the floor in opposition to the amendment, noting that the chamber already approved language exempting faith-based organizations and clergy from ENDA's discrimination protections.

""This amendment threatens to gut the central premise of ENDA,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, who opposed the amendment. ""The amendment is ill-defined, and opens floodgates to all kinds of court cases.""

Greensboro, Ga. (May 3, 2016) – Team Ole Miss went six-under par over the final five holes to win the 2016 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl Challenge by two strokes today at the Reynolds Lake Oconee Resort outside Atlanta.

Head Coach Hugh Freeze and celebrity partner Wesley Walls carded a score of -11 to win the $100,000 first-place prize. Teams from Georgia, Georgia Tech and NC State finished tied for second at nine-under par.

The winning stretch run started when Coach Freeze holed an 8-iron from 150 yards on the par-four 14th for an eagle. The pair then went on to birdie the final four holes to seal the win.

“The ball was jumping off my irons and I knew I hit it good,” Freeze said of the shot. “Then Wesley said he thought he saw it disappear. I thought it was long but I started walking to the hole pretty fast and found out it went in. That’s when we thought we had a chance.”

“I was just nervous and we both had a lot of adrenaline running through our veins,” Walls added. “The way coach was putting we knew we just had to keep the ball in play.”

Ole Miss went five-under par on the front side before stalling with four straight pars on holes 10-13 leading into the eagle that got them going.

“Congratulations to Ole Miss’ Hugh Freeze and Wesley Walls for an outstanding come-from-behind victory today,” said Gary Stokan, president and CEO of Peach Bowl, Inc. “The Rebels have been a wonderful partner of the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, our Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game and now as champions of our Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl Challenge. We are thrilled to donate $100,000 to them for university scholarships and the Hugh and Jill Freeze Foundation.”

According to an explosive new report, labor presidents enjoyed a $60,000 advantage over private sector CEOs. And yet, big labor is attacking chief executives for taking advantage of their employees.

Union leaders earned an average salary of $252,370 in 2016, according to a new report from the Center for Union Facts. The center compiled salary information from federal labor filings from 192 of the largest national, state, and local unions. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, business leaders only earned an average of $194,350 — almost $60,000 less than union bosses, the Washington Free Beacon's Bill McMorris reported.

When other perks were taken into consideration, union officials took home an average of $283,678.

For instance, Airline Pilots Association President Timothy Canoll was the highest-paid union leader, taking home a total compensation of $775,829, with benefits added on top of his base salary of $526,292. The union gave Canoll about $250,000 in perks, including $24,000 in allowances and $29,000 in official business expenses including things like meals and entertainment. And there's the $196,534 in compensation classified as ""Other.""

The Center for Union Facts report didn't come out of a vacuum. It was intended to rebut the AFL-CIO's annual Executive Paywatch report, which highlighted the disparity between CEOs and their employees. The gap between S&P 500 CEOs and their rank-and-file members is enormous, with executives taking $13.1 million compared to $37,632 for the average production worker.

The AFL-CIO characterized this as ""a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 347 to 1

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In this paper, we study the problem of \emph{data-driven} classification of images.
In the standard supervised learning setting, the goal is to learn a function $f$ that maps an image to a label.
This is a challenging task for two reasons.
First, images are high-dimensional, so it is difficult to learn a function that generalizes well to unseen data.
Second, the function $f$ is often not differentiable, and therefore it is difficult to learn $f$ using gradient-based methods.

We consider the problem of learning $f$ without the need to evaluate it on new images.
Instead, we learn $f$ by training on a large collection of labeled images, and then use the learned function to classify new images.
This is known as \emph{one-shot learning}.

Paraphrased The answer is as follows. To organize sections and subsections in a LaTeX document using macros, you should define a macro for an unnumbered section (e.g., \Alph{section}) and another macro for numbered subsections within that section (e.g., \Alph{section}.\arabic{subsection}). By doing this, you can easily call the macro to add a new section or subsection wherever needed in the document, and it will automatically generate the appropriate formatting.

How does using macros in LaTeX benefit users?

Using macros in LaTeX benefits users by allowing them to create professional-looking documents with ease. Macros provide a standardized way of formatting text, tables, and graphics, making it simpler to maintain consistency throughout the document. Additionally, macros allow users to define custom commands or shortcuts for specific tasks, such as citing sources or creating bibliographies. This can save time and effort compared to manual formatting methods. Overall, the use of macros in LaTeX enhances the overall quality and consistency of documents while reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies.
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

A: Macros are a powerful tool in LaTeX. They allow you to create commands that can be used repeatedly throughout your document, saving you time and effort. For example, you could create a macro that adds a page number to the top of each page, saving you the time of manually adding them to each page. You can also use macros to automate tasks such as creating tables or figures, or even to generate documents automatically from templates.
Macros are also useful for organizing your document. For example, you could create a macro that automatically creates a new section or subsection whenever a new section is entered. This allows you to easily add new sections and subsections to your document, without having to manually create them.
Macros can also be used to create custom commands or shortcuts for specific tasks. For example, you could create a macro that automatically generates a bibliography when a certain command is used. This saves you the time of manually creating a bibliography, and allows you to"

How can I use macros to define and organize sections and subsections in a document written in LaTeX?
Paraphrased The answer is as follows. To organize sections and subsections in a LaTeX document using macros, you should define a macro for an unnumbered section (e.g., \Alph{section}) and another macro for numbered subsections within that section (e.g., \Alph{section}.\arabic{subsection}). By doing this, you can easily call the macro to add a new section or subsection wherever needed in the document, and it will automatically generate the appropriate formatting.

Quantum networks transmit quantum information between quantum systems separated by large distances, enabling applications like quantum cryptography and quantum sensing that are not possible with classical communication networks alone~\cite{Wehner_2018,Kimble_2008}. Efforts are underway across the globe to develop the cornerstones of such quantum networks, with the goal of distributing quantum information between quantum memories. These efforts are diverse, employing a range of protocols and hardware to support long-distance, unconditionally secure communication, precision sensing/navigation and distributed quantum computing. On-demand quantum entanglement is now possible between separated quantum memories~\cite{Humphreys_2018} and quantum memories have been shown to offer a clear advantage in the quantum secure information capacity compared to direct transmission over equivalent loss channels~\cite{Bhaskar_2020}. Recent theory established the secret key capacity for arbitrary quantum communication networks~\cite{Pirandola_2017,Pirandola_2019}, and various quantum network routing protocols are being developed~\cite{Muralidharan_2016,Pant_2019,Dahlberg_2019,router_2020} to try and approach these capacities.

But given this multitude of applications, is there a way to quantify the usefulness of a quantum network? 
Even though Ref.~\cite{Pirandola_2019} established the maximum point-to-point quantum communication capacity, it considers channel losses as the only limit on quantum communication rates. In practice, local operation errors and sub-optimal link layer network protocols can also limit the performance of quantum networks. Furthermore, we would like to benchmark quantum networks with respect to other network tasks, such as computing and sensing. In the absence of a commonly agreed-upon framework that can accommodate various quantum network-enabled applications, comparing the capabilities of different quantum networks at various global network tasks remains difficult.

Fundamentally, the value of a network derives from the applications it enables by connecting people and things. A telephone network's worth derives from the utility seen by the callers it connects. The value of a datacenter network derives from the added utility of networked, rather than isolated, computers. A wireless sensor network enabled by 5G technology adds value by connecting sensors that, taken in isolation, would be less valuable: i.e. the utility of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. 

When it comes to quantifying the worth of a quantum network, we are guided by the same principle: we consider how the ability to pass quantum information between devices or people creates new value. 
Specifically, we introduce utility-based metrics to quantify the performance of a quantum network in servicing the diversity of envisioned quantum network applications. These metrics form a general framework for comparing the utility of different quantum networks, such as those illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:illustration}. These metrics can also be used to guide the design of quantum networks, so they can best serve the quantum information needs of their users.

Answer:Sure! Here's my response:

""The main idea of the passage is that a new framework has been proposed to measure the performance of quantum networks in serving various applications.""
Question:What are some potential benefits of using quantum networks in the applications mentioned?
There are several potential benefits of using quantum networks in these applications. For example, secure communication could be enhanced by leveraging the properties of entanglement and superposition to ensure information cannot be intercepted or tampered with. Additionally, precision sensing/navigation could benefit from increased sensitivity and accuracy enabled by quantum systems. Finally, distributed quantum computing holds promise for solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers can currently achieve.
Answer:1. Enhanced security for long distance communication
2. Increased precision and accuracy for navigation tasks
3. Efficient solution of complex problems compared to classical computers

Question:Here is a question.Can quantum networks be used for enhancing cybersecurity?
Paraphrased part: Yes, quantum networks have the potential to significantly enhance cybersecurity by providing unconditionally secure communication. This is because quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used to generate and exchange cryptographic keys in a way that ensures they are not intercepted or altered. This provides a high level of security for long-distance communication, making it suitable for scenarios where traditional encryption methods are vulnerable.

A new survey from Gallup has found that Americans favor President Obama's ""Buffett Rule"" proposal by a wide margin, with 60 percent saying they favor the rule and 37 percent opposing it.

In asking the question, Gallup did not actually use the term ""Buffett Rule."" Here's how the question was asked: ""Would you favor or oppose Congress passing a new law that would require households earning $1 million a year or more to pay a minimum of 30 percent of their income in taxes?""

That conforms to the way President Obama has been describing the proposal, though the version of the bill set for a Senate vote on Monday is slightly more complicated. It would mandate that income above $2 million would be taxed at least at a 30 percent rate, with a graduated boost in the minimum marginal rates for income between $1 million and $2 million. The GOP-led House is not expected to take up the bill, and it is thus not expected to become law.

Seventy-four percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents and 43 percent of independents told Gallup they support the Buffett Rule as articulated by Gallup. Fifty-four percent of Republicans opposed the rule.

Mr. Obama and his allies have been pushing the Buffett Rule in what appears in part to be an attempt to frame the general election. They has been casting the president as a fighter for economic fairness and presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a defender of a status quo that allowed Romney to pay an effective tax rate of just 13.9 percent on $21.7 million in income in 2010. While Mr. Obama wants to raise taxes on some of the highest earners via the Buffett Rule, Romney is proposing a tax cut for the highest earners.

Mr. Obama and first lady Michele Obama released their 2011 joint tax return on Friday, which showed they paid an effective rate of 20.5 percent on an adjusted gross income of $789,674. They would not have been impacted by the Buffett Rule had it been in effect during the 2011 tax period.

The Buffett Rule is named after wealthy investor Warren Buffett, who argues that it is wrong for a billionaire such as himself to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.

In a separate Gallup poll last April, 59 percent of adults said they support increasing taxes on households making $250,000 or more per year. If the Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of the year, taxes will go up on all Americans. Mr. Obama favors letting those tax cuts expire for households making more than $250,000 per year, but extending them for those making less than that threshold; Republicans want to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone

The answer is as follows. The context is about President Obama's ""Buffett Rule"" proposal, which would ensure that high income Americans pay at least 30 percent in taxes. A new survey from Gallup found that Americans favor the proposal by a wide margin. The version of the bill set for a Senate vote on Monday is slightly more complicated and would mandate that income above $2 million would be taxed at least at a 30 percent rate. The GOP-led House is not expected to take up the bill, and it is not expected to become law.

Graph neural networks (GNN) are now the \textit{de facto} standard when it comes to learning the low-dimension embedding on the graph-structured data. It is shown effective in prior works to use the low-dimensional vector embeddings as the input node/graph features for a variety of prediction, recommendation, or any other graph-related analysis~\cite{wu2020comprehensive}. The idea behind it is through aggregating and distilling the high-dimensional information of a node as well as its graph neighborhood into a dense vector form, the principle of which is derived from the natural languages processing (NLP) field~\cite{zhou2020graph}. 

The rise of GNNs comes from the fact that most dominant neural network architectures in the deep learning field focus on dealing with tasks involving grid-like data structures (e.g., images, text corpus). However, it is unpractical not to consider the sheer amount of non-euclidean space data in the case of social networks, molecular protein networks, or financial risk networks~\cite{zhou2020graph}. These types of data can be formed into the graph structure and convey a better interpretation from a human's perspective.

Much interesting research has thus emerged over the last several years to embed the graph-structured data using GNNs, and these GNNs can be generalized in two forms, namely conventional and sampling-based ones~\cite{wu2020comprehensive}. Specifically, a conventional GNN refers to optimizing node's embedding using matrix factorization-based objective in a single, fixed graph, while aggregating knowledge from all connected node pairs. One widely used work is graph convolutional networks (GCN), which could easily lead to the ``neighbor explosion'' problem in the large-scale and dense graph. The recursive expansion across layers in a top-down way also requires expensive convolution computations for all nodes at each time step. One flagship sampling-based model is GraphSAGE, which randomly samples a fixed size of neighbors for each node instead of taking in the whole neighborhood to avoid ``neighbor explosion'' problem. Similarly, other sampling works either resort to the layer-wise sampling~\cite{huang2018adaptive} or graph-level sampling~\cite{graphsaint}. 




It is considered challenging for representation learning due to the need of generalizing the ones on which the algorithm has already been optimized to the unseen nodes/graphs. To this end, we propose an adaptive graph policy-driven sampling model, namely GPS, to generate both node and graph level embedding inductively. The policy-driven sampling is realized through several key steps. It first quantifies the importance of all nodes at each layer recursively, from which a better sense of locality of a given node can be comprehended while sampling the nodes based on the rank of importance. It then integrates the sampling loss into the final graph level classification task, and the importance of the nodes is thus adjusted adaptively along with the change of gradients towards the minimum of loss. The contributions of the paper can be summarized as the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item We propose an innovative policy-driven sampling approach to enhance the generation of the embedding on the graph-structured data, in which the node embedding is updated with the guidance of the policy function, and the graph embedding derives from a shallow multi-layer perceptions network (MLP).
\item We realize the graph representation learning in an end-to-end fashion, including the initial graph construction/vectorization, the adaptive policy-driven sampling/embedding update and graph embedding generation. We quantify the correlations of nodes in the local neighborhood and only sample ones deemed important iteratively. In addition, the sampling process is considered an integral part of the training process and thus adapted dynamically.
\item We conduct extensive experiments on five molecular graph datasets for graph level classification tasks. Compared with the other four state-of-the-art methods, the proposed GPS achieves superior performance among all. We also demonstrate the influence of sampling parameter $K$ on the overall performance of the GPS and implement variants of GPS for ablation study.

The graph neural networks (GNNs) are the mainstream graph representation learning techniques. The GNNs have been proved effective in many graph-related tasks, such as node classification~\cite{hamilton2017inductive,kipf2016semi}, link prediction~\cite{kipf2016semi,kipf2016variational}, graph classification~\cite{hamilton2017inductive,kipf2016semi}, graph generation~\cite{kipf2016semi}, and so on. The GNNs are usually designed as a series of layers, where each layer aggregates the information from the nodes in the previous layer. The most popular one is the graph convolutional networks (GCN)~\cite{kipf2016semi}, which can be viewed as a special case of the GNNs, and is widely used in many real-world applications~\cite{ham"

Question:Clarifying inquiry: Can you provide more details about the adaptive sampling and importance-weighted updating of node embeddings in GPS?

 Certainly! Adaptive sampling in GPS refers to the technique of dynamically selecting nodes or subgraphs during training based on their importance or relevance to the learning task. This allows the model to focus on the most informative parts of the graph, improving efficiency and performance. Importance-weighted updating of node embeddings involves assigning weights to nodes based on their significance and updating their representations accordingly. This ensures that more important nodes have a greater impact on the overall graph representation, leading to more informative and accurate results.

We're gonna continue doing that — we're gonna continue doing that as a team with the president leading that effort.""
