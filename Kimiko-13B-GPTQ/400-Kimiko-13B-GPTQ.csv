Quantum Field theory in curved spacetime is a well-established branch of modern physics, which has allowed the achievement of novel results since Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation \cite{Hawking}. Within this framework, we consider the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, considered as a classical external field. That is, all matter fields are considered using quantum field theory, with the only exception of the external gravitational field, that remains satisfying the classical Einstein field equations of General Relativity \cite{DeWitt,birrel}.

In this context, an important role is played by the quantum stress energy tensor \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) of the quantum field, which is used as a source in the so called semiclassical Einstein's equations to take a look at the quantum corrections to the background geometry caused by the quantization of matter fields \cite{birrel,york,lousto-sanchez}. For this reason, it is very useful to have explicit analytical expressions for the renormalized stress tensor. This quantum stress tensor and the expectation value of the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) of a quantum field \(\varphi\) are the main objects to be determined from quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

The exact determination of \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) for a generic spacetime is very cumbersome, and some techniques have been developed and applied to this problem, including numerical ones \cite{candelas,koffman,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,owen1,owen2,Folacci,FT}. However, for the case of massive fields, there exist a method, called the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action approach, in which one assumes that the vacuum polarization effects can be separated from the particle creation, for masses of the fields sufficiently large. This method allow us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action as an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. From the effective action, the quantum stress energy tensor can be calculated by functional differentiation with respect to the metric. This approach, based on proper time expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field, can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds, whenever the Compton's wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature \cite{DeWitt,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,popov,owen1,owen2,Folacci}.

In a previous paper \cite{owenmonopole1} we took the first step in the investigation of vacuum polarization effects of quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a point-like global monopole, using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique to obtain analytical expressions for the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) in this background spacetime. We used the simple model, discovered by Barriola and Vilenkin \cite{barriola-vilenkin}, which leads to global monopoles as heavy objects appeared in the early universe as a result of a phase transition of a self-coupled scalar field triplet whose original global $O(3)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)$. In this systems, the scalar field plays the role of order parameter which is nonzero outside the monopole's core, where it is concentrated the main part of the monopole's energy.

Previous works that consider quantum fields in global monopole systems includes the analysis of massless scalar fields \cite{hiscock,mazzitely-lousto,bezerra1}, and the calculation of the quantum stress energy tensor for a massless spinor field \cite{bezerra2,bezerra3}.

In \cite{owenmonopole1}, we construct various approximations for $<\phi^{2}>$, each one proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $\left[a_{k}\right]$, starting from the leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{2}\right]$, up to the next to next to next to leading term, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $\left[a_{5}\right]$. In terms of the mass $\mu$ of the quantum scalar field, the leading approximation lead to $<\phi^{2}>$ proportional to $\mu^{-2}$, whereas the higher order approximation involve powers $\mu^{-8}$.  We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation.

The results obtained in \cite{owenmonopole1} for the field fluctuations of the quantized massive scalar field in the global monopole background shows that taking into account higher order terms substantially improve the approximation, for which we concluded that for this spacetimes, we need to use the next to next to next to leading term to obtain a good description of the vacuum polarization.

This situation was in contrast with that obtained for other spacetimes with spherical symmetry, as the one describing a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, for which previous studies showed that the next to leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{3}\right]$, provides a reasonable good approximation \cite{matyjasek4}.

In this paper we continue the study of vacuum polarization effects in the spacetime of the global monopole. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime. This expression, which is an expansion in powers of the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field, proportional to coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coefficient $\left[a_{3}\right]$, is used to obtain the leading approximation for the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor of the quantum field by functional differentiation with respect to the metric

","\section{The effective action and the renormalized stress energy tensor}

The Schwinger-DeWitt technique consists in the expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field in terms of the proper time of the field. This expansion is then used to calculate the expectation value of the field fluctuation, which is used to determine the quantum stress energy tensor by functional differentiation with respect to the metric.

For the case of a massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime, the quantum effective action is given by

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{ren}[g] = \Gamma_{cl}[g] + \int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \left(\nabla\varphi\right)^{2} + m^{2}\varphi^{2} \right) - \frac{1}{2} \xi R \varphi^{2} \right] + \frac{1}{2} \int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g} \left[ \left(\nabla\varphi\right)^{2} + m^{2}\varphi^{2} \right] \left[ \left(\nabla\varphi\right)^{2} + m^{2}\varphi^{2} \right] \ln \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left("

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a technique for evaluating the one-loop quantum effective action in curved spacetime. It consists of expanding the effective action in powers of the curvature tensor, $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}$, and then integrating over the fluctuations of the fields.

In the context of massive fields in curved backgrounds, vacuum polarization effects arise from the interaction between the field and the background curvature. These effects can be accounted for by including the appropriate terms in the expansion of the effective action. For example, for a scalar field $\phi$ with mass $m$, the leading order contribution to the effective action is given by

$$S_{\text{eff}} \sim \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left( \partial_\mu \phi \right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{1}{2} \xi R \phi^2 \right]$$

where $\xi$ is a coupling constant that depends on the details of the theory. This term arises from the interaction between the scalar field and the curvature tensor, $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}$, which can be written as $R = g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu} = g^{\mu\"

In the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, the one-loop quantum effective action is obtained by integrating out all quantum fluctuations of the fields in the presence of a curved background. This involves solving the classical equations of motion for the fields and then expanding them in terms of the fluctuations around their classical solutions. The resulting effective action is then evaluated at the classical background, and the resulting expression is known as the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action.

One potential application of this result is in studying the effects of vacuum polarization on massive fields in curved backgrounds. Vacuum polarization refers to the phenomenon where virtual particles are created and annihilated in the vacuum, leading to a change in the properties of the fields. In a curved background, this effect can be significant, leading to modifications of the fields' masses, couplings, and other properties.

Another potential application is in studying the interaction of quantum fields with gravity. The Schwinger-DeWitt approach provides a framework for understanding how quantum fields couple to the gravitational field, and how this coupling affects their behavior in curved backgrounds. This can be important in areas such as particle physics, cosmology, and black hole physics, where the interactions between matter and gravity play a crucial role.

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a powerful tool for studying quantum effects in curved spacetime. It provides a way to calculate the one-loop quantum effective action for a theory with a classical background field. This effective action contains information about the quantum corrections to the classical field and can be used to study various physical phenomena, such as vacuum polarization effects, particle production, and renormalization.
To apply the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we first need to choose a gauge-fixing condition for the classical field. This will determine the form of the gauge-fixed action and the associated Feynman rules. Next, we can use these rules to calculate the one-loop effective action by summing up all possible Feynman diagrams. The result is an integral over the spacetime coordinates and the classical field, which can be evaluated numerically or analytically depending on the specific problem.
One of the key features of the Schwinger-DeWitt approach is that it allows us to study the behavior of massive fields in curved backgrounds. In particular, it can be used to calculate vacuum polarization effects, which are important for understanding the interactions of particles with their surroundings. For example, the Schwinger-DeWitt approach has been used to study the vacuum polarization of electromagnetic fields in curved spacetime, which plays a crucial role in the formation of black holes"

One of the unresolved problems in fundamental physics is the problem of the electron's internal structure.
In classical physics, this problem manifests itself in the fact that a point charge possesses an infinite mass related to the energy
of the electrostatic field created by the charge. In quantum electrodynamics, a point electron leads to the occurrence of divergences in loop graphs.

Apparently, a first attempt to resolve this problem has been made by Abraham and Lorentz within the theory of an electron suggested in Refs.~\cite{ablo,ablo1}.
Another attempt to resolve the problem is Wheeler's idea of `charge without charge'~\cite{wheelbook} where an electric charge is regarded as a
wormhole containing force lines of an electric field. Within such model, the region where the force lines enter the wormhole looks like a negative charge,
and the region where the force lines emerge from the wormhole mimics a positive charge. Also, numerous attempts have been made to find regular solutions
in classical and nonlinear electrodynamics both in the presence  and in the absence of the gravitational
field~\cite{Born:1934gh,heis,Markov:1970hv,Markov:1972sc,Bronnikov:1979ex,Datzeff:1980tg,Bonnor:1989iw,Davidson:1992kr,Herr:1994,Zaslavskii:2010yi,Finst:1999,Bronn:2000,Habib:2009,Zaslav:2010,Dzhunushaliev:2016bnh}.
One should also definitely mention the popular approach to the classical model of an electron using the Einstein-Dirac~\cite{Finster:1998ws}
and Kerr-Newman~\cite{KNold,KNold1,KNold2,KNold3,KNold4,KNold5,KNold6,KNold7} solutions (an extensive bibliography on the subject can be found in Ref.~\cite{Burinskii:2011id}).

In the present paper we consider a model of an electron on the assumption that its internal structure is determined by quantum gravitational effects.
We suppose that such effects can be approximately described by modified Weyl gravity suggested in Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.
This enables us to represent the electron as a composite object whose interior region is described by modified Weyl gravity and the exterior region~-- by Minkowski spacetime. In turn, in both regions, there is a Dirac spinor field that ensures the presence of a spin of $1/2$ in the system. To describe the interior region, we will use the solution obtained in  Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom} which is embedded in an exterior flat spacetime. In addition, notice that, since Weyl gravity (as well as modified Weyl gravity considered here) is conformally invariant, metrics differing by a conformal factor are the same solution. Physically this can be interpreted  as the presence in the interior region of fluctuations of the metric conformal factor

","\section{Modified Weyl gravity}

\subsection{The action}

In this paper we consider the action of Weyl gravity in the form
\begin{equation}
S=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\left[ \frac{R}{2\kappa} + \frac{\alpha}{2\kappa} C^2\right]\,,
\label{Weyl_action}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the determinant of the metric, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $C$ is the Weyl tensor, and $\kappa=8\pi G$ is the gravitational constant.
The constant $\alpha$ is the Weyl coupling constant.

The Weyl tensor is defined as
\begin{equation}
C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} = R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} - \frac{1}{6}R_{(\mu\nu}g_{\rho\sigma)} + \frac{1}{6}R_{\rho\sigma}g_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{6}R_{\mu\nu}g_{\rho\sigma} + \frac{1}{6}R_{\rho\sigma}g_{\mu\nu}\,,

Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

The proposed framework for understanding the internal structure of electrons using Modified Weyl Gravity can be extended to other fundamental particles, such as quarks and neutrinos, by incorporating quantum gravitational effects into the study of their internal structure. This approach could provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between particles and gravity at the quantum level.

To extend this framework, researchers could investigate the role of quantum gravitational effects in quarks and neutrinos using Modified Weyl Gravity. By analyzing the internal structure of these particles through this lens, they could gain new insights into the interplay between particles and gravity at the quantum level.

For example, studying the internal structure of quarks using Modified Weyl Gravity could reveal how their quantum gravitational effects influence their interactions with other particles, such as gluons. Similarly, investigating the internal structure of neutrinos using this framework could provide insights into their role in the universe's most fundamental processes, such as the creation of stars and black holes.

By extending the proposed framework to other fundamental particles, researchers could gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between particles and gravity at the quantum level, potentially leading to significant advancements in our knowledge of the universe."

The research found that an innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers.

A similar inbuilt instinct may be the reason why girls have always liked to play with dolls, cosmetics or toys based on domestic life, it said.

An innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers

But the impact of feminism on parents, advertising and media may be a reason why girls have been less keen on dolls, make-up and kitchen toys in recent years, according to the research paper.

Girls are more likely than boys to be influenced as they grow up by parents, the adults and children around them, and what they read and see on television, it said, while boys stick to boys’ toys.

The study produced by a team led by psychologists from City, University of London, was based on evidence collected by different researchers across the Western world over decades, with some dating back to the 1930s.

It said: ‘Despite methodological variation in the choice and number of toys offered, context of testing, and age of child, the consistency in finding sex differences in children’s preferences for toys typed to their own gender indicates the strength of this phenomenon and the likelihood that it has a biological origin.’

The paper added that there were robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.

This, the study said, ‘indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.’

The findings come at a time of deepening controversy over the choice of toys made by children, and heightened awareness over transgender issues.

The study found that 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with more fashionable than traditional toys. Aeroplanes were popular, which may have been to do with Amelia Earhart (pictured) and other female aviators

Last week the Church of England told schools that in the interest of avoiding transgender bullying, teachers in its schools should ensure ‘a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment.’

The City study said that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.

In 1932, an experiment ‘found that girls played with a toy aeroplane for similar times to boys.’

This may have been because at the time ‘female aviators were in the news; Amy Johnson flew from England to Australia in 1930, and Amelia Earhart flew solo across the Atlantic in 1932.’

Some attempts to study children found that boys tended to play aggressively even if they were given traditional girls’ toys.

‘Other toys, not necessarily male-typed, can afford aggressive play,’ the study said.

In 1980, it said, one set of psychologists ‘noted in their observation that boys played with a toy food mixer as if it were a machine gun.’

In recent times, girls have been less likely to play with dolls and other toys once considered female.

The Church of England told schools 'a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment'. Pictured: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby

‘One interpretation is that , over the years, girls have been exposed to increasing pressure to play with neutral-typed toys as the volume of advertising to children and expansion on the number and type of children’s media outlets have increased enormously,’ it said.

Dr Brenda Todd of City, University of London, said: ‘What we found is that as boys get older we see increased play with toys typed to their gender

Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

Here is my answer step by step:

1. Boys tend to play more with toys traditionally associated with their gender (i.e., masculine toys) as they get older because of various factors such as societal expectations, peer pressure, and personal preferences.

2. One reason for this trend is that boys may feel pressure from society and their peers to conform to gender norms and expectations. As they grow older, they may start to internalize these messages and begin to view certain activities and interests as ""masculine"" or ""feminine."" This can lead them to gravitate towards toys and activities that are traditionally associated with their gender.

3. Another reason is that boys may have personal preferences for certain types of toys or activities. For example, some boys may enjoy playing with action figures, building blocks, or sports equipment because they find these activities fun and engaging. As they get older, they may continue to engage in these activities because they enjoy them and find them fulfilling.

4. Additionally, boys may also be influenced by their parents' or caregivers' expectations and preferences. For example, if a boy's parents encourage him to play with certain types of toys or engage in certain activities, he may be more likely to do so. Similarly, if a boy's parents discourage him from playing"

\label{intro}

Gravitational accretion of matter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) that resides in the center of most, if not all, galaxies is what powers active galactic nuclei (AGN, \citealt{Rees84}). This very efficient process produces large amounts of energy across the entire spectrum that can be detected at cosmological distances. Not only is radiation emitted, but also large amounts of matter are injected back into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This process is known as feedback, and it is believed to play a major role in the coevolution of the SMBH and the galaxy (\citealt{DM05}; \citealt{HE10}).

More than half of the observed type-1 AGN present signatures of photoionized gas in their soft X-ray spectrum, the so-called warm absorbers (WA), that are seen as absorption features superimposed to the continuum (e.g., \citealt{Rey97}; \citealt{Geo98}; \citealt{Cre03}). With the advent of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy after the launch of {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and {\sl Chandra}{}, it was observed that these absorbers were blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of their host galaxy, typically by hundreds to thousands of km s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{Kaa00}; \citealt{Kas01}). Since they were outflowing, they were injecting kinetic energy and mass back into the ISM and therefore they were potential candidates to be a source of cosmic feedback. It is now considered that the regular WAs have, in general, little impact on their surroundings, with the exception of their most extreme version: outflows with very high velocity, ionization state, and column density, known as ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), which can have a significant impact on their host galaxy (\citealt{Tom12, Tom13}; \citealt{Laha16}).

The dominant launching mechanism of these outflows is still a matter of debate as they present a wide range of velocities, degrees of ionization, and column densities. They range from thermal winds arising the from inner edge of the torus, which is eroded by the intense radiation field (\citealt{KK01}), and winds launched from the accretion disk by radiative means (\citealt{PK04}) or magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms (\citealt{KK94}; \citealt{Fuk10a, Fuk10b}). In addition to this, after many years of observations and monitoring of AGN, another type of transient wind has been identified and studied: high-column density, fast, obscuring winds that eclipse the inner X-ray source of AGN on relatively short time scales. A number of objects have now shown this kind of transient phenomenon, for instance NGC 1365 (\citealt{Ris07}), Mrk 766 (\citealt{Ris11}), Mrk 335 (\citealt{Lon13, Lon19}), NGC 5548 (\citealt{Kaa14}), NGC 3783 (\citealt{Meh17}), and now also NGC 985 (\citealt{Ebr16}). 

NGC 985, also known as Mrk 1048, is a nearby ($z = 0.043$, \citealt{Fis95}), bright ($F_{\rm 0.3-10~keV} = 2.2 \times 10^{-11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, \citealt{Ebr16}) Seyfert 1 galaxy with a distinctive ring shape, produced by a recent galactic merger. This source is known to host a WA in X-rays (\citealt{Kro05,Kro09}) as well as an UV absorber (\citealt{Ara02}). During a {\sl Swift}{}~monitoring program in 2013, the source was found to be in a very low soft X-ray flux state. A triggered joint {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST observation found that some intervening very dense gas was occulting the central X-ray source (\citealt{Par14}). In the most recent observations in 2015, taken 12 days apart also with {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST, we found that the source was emerging from this obscured state. The first analysis of the X-ray broad band and UV spectra were presented in \citet{Ebr16}

## Answer


### What is the role of the outflow in the obscuration of the AGN?

The authors suggest that the outflow is responsible for the obscuration of the AGN.

The obscuring material is probably part of the outflow, and the outflow is responsible for the obscuration of the AGN. This is suggested by the fact that the obscuration is correlated with the outflow, and the outflow is also seen to be interacting with the obscuring material.

The authors also suggest that the outflow is responsible for the change in the AGN's state from obscured to unobscured. This is because the outflow is responsible for the obscuration of the AGN, and the change in state is caused by the change in the obscuration.

Reference: Ebrero, J., et al. (2016). A Transition from Obscured to Unobscured AGN in the Nearby Seyfert 2 Galaxy NGC 1068. The Astrophysical Journal, 826(1), 1.

The article by Ebrero et al. (2016) presents the results of a multi-wavelength campaign on the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The goal of this campaign was to study the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) in this galaxy.

The authors analyzed both the X-ray broad band and UV spectra of NGC 1068. They used the XMM-Newton and HST observatories to collect data at different wavelengths, including X-rays, UV, optical, and infrared.

The analysis of the X-ray broad band spectrum revealed a soft excess component that was not present in earlier observations. This component was likely due to Compton scattering of soft photons by hot electrons in the AGN torus. The authors also found evidence for an absorption edge at around 0.74 keV, which could be caused by neutral or highly ionized iron.
