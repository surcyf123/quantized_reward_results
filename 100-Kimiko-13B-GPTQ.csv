Quantum Field theory in curved spacetime is a well-established branch of modern physics, which has allowed the achievement of novel results since Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation \cite{Hawking}. Within this framework, we consider the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, considered as a classical external field. That is, all matter fields are considered using quantum field theory, with the only exception of the external gravitational field, that remains satisfying the classical Einstein field equations of General Relativity \cite{DeWitt,birrel}.

In this context, an important role is played by the quantum stress energy tensor \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) of the quantum field, which is used as a source in the so called semiclassical Einstein's equations to take a look at the quantum corrections to the background geometry caused by the quantization of matter fields \cite{birrel,york,lousto-sanchez}. For this reason, it is very useful to have explicit analytical expressions for the renormalized stress tensor. This quantum stress tensor and the expectation value of the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) of a quantum field \(\varphi\) are the main objects to be determined from quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

The exact determination of \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) for a generic spacetime is very cumbersome, and some techniques have been developed and applied to this problem, including numerical ones \cite{candelas,koffman,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,owen1,owen2,Folacci,FT}. However, for the case of massive fields, there exist a method, called the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action approach, in which one assumes that the vacuum polarization effects can be separated from the particle creation, for masses of the fields sufficiently large. This method allow us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action as an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. From the effective action, the quantum stress energy tensor can be calculated by functional differentiation with respect to the metric. This approach, based on proper time expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field, can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds, whenever the Compton's wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature \cite{DeWitt,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,popov,owen1,owen2,Folacci}.

In a previous paper \cite{owenmonopole1} we took the first step in the investigation of vacuum polarization effects of quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a point-like global monopole, using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique to obtain analytical expressions for the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) in this background spacetime. We used the simple model, discovered by Barriola and Vilenkin \cite{barriola-vilenkin}, which leads to global monopoles as heavy objects appeared in the early universe as a result of a phase transition of a self-coupled scalar field triplet whose original global $O(3)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)$. In this systems, the scalar field plays the role of order parameter which is nonzero outside the monopole's core, where it is concentrated the main part of the monopole's energy.

Previous works that consider quantum fields in global monopole systems includes the analysis of massless scalar fields \cite{hiscock,mazzitely-lousto,bezerra1}, and the calculation of the quantum stress energy tensor for a massless spinor field \cite{bezerra2,bezerra3}.

In \cite{owenmonopole1}, we construct various approximations for $<\phi^{2}>$, each one proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $\left[a_{k}\right]$, starting from the leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{2}\right]$, up to the next to next to next to leading term, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $\left[a_{5}\right]$. In terms of the mass $\mu$ of the quantum scalar field, the leading approximation lead to $<\phi^{2}>$ proportional to $\mu^{-2}$, whereas the higher order approximation involve powers $\mu^{-8}$.  We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation.

The results obtained in \cite{owenmonopole1} for the field fluctuations of the quantized massive scalar field in the global monopole background shows that taking into account higher order terms substantially improve the approximation, for which we concluded that for this spacetimes, we need to use the next to next to next to leading term to obtain a good description of the vacuum polarization.

This situation was in contrast with that obtained for other spacetimes with spherical symmetry, as the one describing a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, for which previous studies showed that the next to leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{3}\right]$, provides a reasonable good approximation \cite{matyjasek4}.

In this paper we continue the study of vacuum polarization effects in the spacetime of the global monopole. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime. This expression, which is an expansion in powers of the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field, proportional to coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coefficient $\left[a_{3}\right]$, is used to obtain the leading approximation for the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor of the quantum field by functional differentiation with respect to the metric

","\section{The effective action}

The starting point of the Schwinger-DeWitt approach is the quantum effective action, which is an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. In this section we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime.

\subsection{The effective action}

The effective action is a functional of the quantum field $\varphi$, which is the solution of the quantum field equation
\begin{equation}
\left(\square+m^{2}\right)\varphi=\frac{\delta S_{eff}}{\delta\varphi},
\end{equation}
where $S_{eff}$ is the quantum effective action. The effective action is defined as
\begin{equation}
S_{eff}[\varphi]=\frac{1}{2}\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\varphi\left(\square+m^{2}\right)\varphi+\frac{1}{4}\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\varphi^{4}.
\end{equation}

The quantum effective action is a functional of the quantum field $\varphi$, and its expectation value is given by
\begin{equation}
S_{eff}[\varphi]=\frac{1}{2}\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\left\langle \varphi\"

Answer: The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a method to calculate the one-loop effective action of quantum fields in curved backgrounds.

The idea is that the one-loop effective action is a functional of the metric and its derivatives, and that the functional can be expanded in powers of the metric. The expansion is known as the DeWitt expansion. The expansion is of the form

$$\Gamma[\phi] = \Gamma_0[\phi] + \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{1}{2} R + \frac{1}{6} R^2 + \frac{1}{30} R^3 + \frac{1}{40} R^4 + \frac{1}{30} R^3_F + \frac{1}{20} R^4_F + \cdots \right)$$

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a technique for computing the quantum corrections to the classical action in curved spacetime. It is particularly useful for computing the one-loop quantum effective action, which is the sum of all the quantum corrections to the classical action.

The basic idea behind the Schwinger-DeWitt approach is to expand the quantum fields in terms of a complete set of eigenfunctions of the operator corresponding to the curvature of the spacetime. This allows us to write down the action for the quantum fields as a sum over all possible states, with each term representing a contribution from a particular eigenfunction.

For example, consider a scalar field $\phi$ in a curved spacetime with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$. The action for the quantum field can be written as

$$S[\phi] = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi - V(\phi) \right]$$

where $V(\phi)$ is the potential term. To compute the quantum corrections to this action, we need to expand $\phi$ in terms of eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ of the operator $-\nabla^2$ (or equivalently, the operator $-\nabla_\mu \nabla^\mu$):

1. First, let's consider the case of a scalar field $\phi$ in a curved spacetime with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$. The Lagrangian density for this field is given by
$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \partial_\mu \phi \right)^2 - V(\phi)
$$
where $V(\phi)$ is the potential energy term.

2. To calculate the vacuum polarization effects of this field, we need to find the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ in the vacuum state. This can be done using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, which involves expanding the action in powers of the field and its derivatives, and then integrating over all possible field configurations.

3. In the case of a massless scalar field, the one-loop contribution to the energy-momentum tensor can be expressed as
$$
T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{1-loop}} = \frac{1}{16 \pi G} \left[ \left( \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu} \square \right) R + 4 R_{\mu\nu} - 2 g_{\mu\nu} R^2 + 2 g_{\mu\nu} \square R \"

Question:What is the Schwinger-DeWitt approach?

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a technique for calculating the quantum effective action in curved backgrounds. It involves expanding the effective action in powers of the curvature tensor and its derivatives, and then performing a path-integral over all possible fields. The resulting expression for the effective action is an integral over all possible fields, with the integration measure being the Haar measure of the gauge group."

One of the unresolved problems in fundamental physics is the problem of the electron's internal structure.
In classical physics, this problem manifests itself in the fact that a point charge possesses an infinite mass related to the energy
of the electrostatic field created by the charge. In quantum electrodynamics, a point electron leads to the occurrence of divergences in loop graphs.

Apparently, a first attempt to resolve this problem has been made by Abraham and Lorentz within the theory of an electron suggested in Refs.~\cite{ablo,ablo1}.
Another attempt to resolve the problem is Wheeler's idea of `charge without charge'~\cite{wheelbook} where an electric charge is regarded as a
wormhole containing force lines of an electric field. Within such model, the region where the force lines enter the wormhole looks like a negative charge,
and the region where the force lines emerge from the wormhole mimics a positive charge. Also, numerous attempts have been made to find regular solutions
in classical and nonlinear electrodynamics both in the presence  and in the absence of the gravitational
field~\cite{Born:1934gh,heis,Markov:1970hv,Markov:1972sc,Bronnikov:1979ex,Datzeff:1980tg,Bonnor:1989iw,Davidson:1992kr,Herr:1994,Zaslavskii:2010yi,Finst:1999,Bronn:2000,Habib:2009,Zaslav:2010,Dzhunushaliev:2016bnh}.
One should also definitely mention the popular approach to the classical model of an electron using the Einstein-Dirac~\cite{Finster:1998ws}
and Kerr-Newman~\cite{KNold,KNold1,KNold2,KNold3,KNold4,KNold5,KNold6,KNold7} solutions (an extensive bibliography on the subject can be found in Ref.~\cite{Burinskii:2011id}).

In the present paper we consider a model of an electron on the assumption that its internal structure is determined by quantum gravitational effects.
We suppose that such effects can be approximately described by modified Weyl gravity suggested in Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.
This enables us to represent the electron as a composite object whose interior region is described by modified Weyl gravity and the exterior region~-- by Minkowski spacetime. In turn, in both regions, there is a Dirac spinor field that ensures the presence of a spin of $1/2$ in the system. To describe the interior region, we will use the solution obtained in  Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom} which is embedded in an exterior flat spacetime. In addition, notice that, since Weyl gravity (as well as modified Weyl gravity considered here) is conformally invariant, metrics differing by a conformal factor are the same solution. Physically this can be interpreted  as the presence in the interior region of fluctuations of the metric conformal factor

The research found that an innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers.

A similar inbuilt instinct may be the reason why girls have always liked to play with dolls, cosmetics or toys based on domestic life, it said.

An innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers

But the impact of feminism on parents, advertising and media may be a reason why girls have been less keen on dolls, make-up and kitchen toys in recent years, according to the research paper.

Girls are more likely than boys to be influenced as they grow up by parents, the adults and children around them, and what they read and see on television, it said, while boys stick to boys’ toys.

The study produced by a team led by psychologists from City, University of London, was based on evidence collected by different researchers across the Western world over decades, with some dating back to the 1930s.

It said: ‘Despite methodological variation in the choice and number of toys offered, context of testing, and age of child, the consistency in finding sex differences in children’s preferences for toys typed to their own gender indicates the strength of this phenomenon and the likelihood that it has a biological origin.’

The paper added that there were robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.

This, the study said, ‘indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.’

The findings come at a time of deepening controversy over the choice of toys made by children, and heightened awareness over transgender issues.

The study found that 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with more fashionable than traditional toys. Aeroplanes were popular, which may have been to do with Amelia Earhart (pictured) and other female aviators

Last week the Church of England told schools that in the interest of avoiding transgender bullying, teachers in its schools should ensure ‘a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment.’

The City study said that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.

In 1932, an experiment ‘found that girls played with a toy aeroplane for similar times to boys.’

This may have been because at the time ‘female aviators were in the news; Amy Johnson flew from England to Australia in 1930, and Amelia Earhart flew solo across the Atlantic in 1932.’

Some attempts to study children found that boys tended to play aggressively even if they were given traditional girls’ toys.

‘Other toys, not necessarily male-typed, can afford aggressive play,’ the study said.

In 1980, it said, one set of psychologists ‘noted in their observation that boys played with a toy food mixer as if it were a machine gun.’

In recent times, girls have been less likely to play with dolls and other toys once considered female.

The Church of England told schools 'a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment'. Pictured: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby

‘One interpretation is that , over the years, girls have been exposed to increasing pressure to play with neutral-typed toys as the volume of advertising to children and expansion on the number and type of children’s media outlets have increased enormously,’ it said.

Dr Brenda Todd of City, University of London, said: ‘What we found is that as boys get older we see increased play with toys typed to their gender

","‘Girls, on the other hand, show less and less preference for toys typed to their gender as they get older.

‘This is not to say that girls don’t play with toys typed to their gender, they do, but the preferences are not as strong as for boys.

‘The fact that the preferences for toys typed to their gender are stronger for boys than for girls suggests that the drive to play with toys typed to their gender is stronger for boys than for girls.’

Dr Todd added: ‘The fact that the preferences for toys typed to their gender are stronger for boys than for girls suggests that the drive to play with toys typed to their gender is stronger for boys than for girls.’

The study said: ‘Given that girls are more likely to be influenced by their social environment than boys, the persistence of sex differences in children’s toy preferences in the face of such changes in the social environment suggests that these differences are not entirely socially determined.’

The study also said that the sex of a child’s parents may influence the toys they are attracted to.

It said: ‘There is evidence that children’s toy preferences are influenced by the sex of their parents.

‘For example, children with two male parents are more likely to play with male-typed toys than children with two female parents.’

Question:Sure! Here's my question about the text:

 Why do you think this trend of boys playing more with traditional masculine toys as they get older is observed in the study?

And here are the key takeaways from the text:

Key Takeaways:

1. Boys tend to play more with toys traditionally associated with their gender (i.e., masculine toys) as they get older.
2. This trend is observed in a recent study conducted by Dr. Brenda Todd of City, University of London.
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

Here is my reasoning:

1. One possible explanation for this trend is that as boys grow older, they become more aware of societal expectations and norms regarding gender roles and stereotypes. They may start to internalize these ideas and conform to them, leading to a preference for toys that are associated with their gender.

2. Another factor that could contribute to this trend is peer pressure. As boys interact with other children and observe their behavior, they may start to feel pressure to conform to certain expectations and engage in activities that are considered ""masculine."" This could include playing with toys that are traditionally associated with boys, such as sports equipment, action figures, or building sets.

3. Additionally, parents may also play a role in influencing their children's toy preferences. For example, they may encourage their sons to play with masculine toys or discourage them from playing with toys that are considered ""girly."" This could reinforce gender stereotypes and contribute to the trend of boys playing more with masculine toys as they get older.

4. Finally, it's important to note that while there may be some truth to the idea that boys tend to play more with masculine toys as they get older, it's not necessarily a universal trend. Some boys may continue to enjoy playing with a variety of to"

\label{intro}

Gravitational accretion of matter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) that resides in the center of most, if not all, galaxies is what powers active galactic nuclei (AGN, \citealt{Rees84}). This very efficient process produces large amounts of energy across the entire spectrum that can be detected at cosmological distances. Not only is radiation emitted, but also large amounts of matter are injected back into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This process is known as feedback, and it is believed to play a major role in the coevolution of the SMBH and the galaxy (\citealt{DM05}; \citealt{HE10}).

More than half of the observed type-1 AGN present signatures of photoionized gas in their soft X-ray spectrum, the so-called warm absorbers (WA), that are seen as absorption features superimposed to the continuum (e.g., \citealt{Rey97}; \citealt{Geo98}; \citealt{Cre03}). With the advent of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy after the launch of {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and {\sl Chandra}{}, it was observed that these absorbers were blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of their host galaxy, typically by hundreds to thousands of km s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{Kaa00}; \citealt{Kas01}). Since they were outflowing, they were injecting kinetic energy and mass back into the ISM and therefore they were potential candidates to be a source of cosmic feedback. It is now considered that the regular WAs have, in general, little impact on their surroundings, with the exception of their most extreme version: outflows with very high velocity, ionization state, and column density, known as ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), which can have a significant impact on their host galaxy (\citealt{Tom12, Tom13}; \citealt{Laha16}).

The dominant launching mechanism of these outflows is still a matter of debate as they present a wide range of velocities, degrees of ionization, and column densities. They range from thermal winds arising the from inner edge of the torus, which is eroded by the intense radiation field (\citealt{KK01}), and winds launched from the accretion disk by radiative means (\citealt{PK04}) or magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms (\citealt{KK94}; \citealt{Fuk10a, Fuk10b}). In addition to this, after many years of observations and monitoring of AGN, another type of transient wind has been identified and studied: high-column density, fast, obscuring winds that eclipse the inner X-ray source of AGN on relatively short time scales. A number of objects have now shown this kind of transient phenomenon, for instance NGC 1365 (\citealt{Ris07}), Mrk 766 (\citealt{Ris11}), Mrk 335 (\citealt{Lon13, Lon19}), NGC 5548 (\citealt{Kaa14}), NGC 3783 (\citealt{Meh17}), and now also NGC 985 (\citealt{Ebr16}). 

NGC 985, also known as Mrk 1048, is a nearby ($z = 0.043$, \citealt{Fis95}), bright ($F_{\rm 0.3-10~keV} = 2.2 \times 10^{-11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, \citealt{Ebr16}) Seyfert 1 galaxy with a distinctive ring shape, produced by a recent galactic merger. This source is known to host a WA in X-rays (\citealt{Kro05,Kro09}) as well as an UV absorber (\citealt{Ara02}). During a {\sl Swift}{}~monitoring program in 2013, the source was found to be in a very low soft X-ray flux state. A triggered joint {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST observation found that some intervening very dense gas was occulting the central X-ray source (\citealt{Par14}). In the most recent observations in 2015, taken 12 days apart also with {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST, we found that the source was emerging from this obscured state. The first analysis of the X-ray broad band and UV spectra were presented in \citet{Ebr16}

What is the meaning of the ""BPT-like"" classification?

In the paper, the authors state that the X-ray spectrum of the AGN is ""BPT-like"".

The BPT-diagram is a plot of the flux ratios of emission lines from the ionized gas in a galaxy, which can be used to classify galaxies according to their ionization state.

The authors are saying that the spectrum of the AGN is similar to the spectrum of a galaxy with a starburst."
