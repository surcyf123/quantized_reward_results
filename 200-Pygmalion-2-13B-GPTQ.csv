Quantum Field theory in curved spacetime is a well-established branch of modern physics, which has allowed the achievement of novel results since Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation \cite{Hawking}. Within this framework, we consider the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, considered as a classical external field. That is, all matter fields are considered using quantum field theory, with the only exception of the external gravitational field, that remains satisfying the classical Einstein field equations of General Relativity \cite{DeWitt,birrel}.

In this context, an important role is played by the quantum stress energy tensor \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) of the quantum field, which is used as a source in the so called semiclassical Einstein's equations to take a look at the quantum corrections to the background geometry caused by the quantization of matter fields \cite{birrel,york,lousto-sanchez}. For this reason, it is very useful to have explicit analytical expressions for the renormalized stress tensor. This quantum stress tensor and the expectation value of the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) of a quantum field \(\varphi\) are the main objects to be determined from quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

The exact determination of \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) for a generic spacetime is very cumbersome, and some techniques have been developed and applied to this problem, including numerical ones \cite{candelas,koffman,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,owen1,owen2,Folacci,FT}. However, for the case of massive fields, there exist a method, called the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action approach, in which one assumes that the vacuum polarization effects can be separated from the particle creation, for masses of the fields sufficiently large. This method allow us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action as an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. From the effective action, the quantum stress energy tensor can be calculated by functional differentiation with respect to the metric. This approach, based on proper time expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field, can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds, whenever the Compton's wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature \cite{DeWitt,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,popov,owen1,owen2,Folacci}.

In a previous paper \cite{owenmonopole1} we took the first step in the investigation of vacuum polarization effects of quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a point-like global monopole, using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique to obtain analytical expressions for the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) in this background spacetime. We used the simple model, discovered by Barriola and Vilenkin \cite{barriola-vilenkin}, which leads to global monopoles as heavy objects appeared in the early universe as a result of a phase transition of a self-coupled scalar field triplet whose original global $O(3)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)$. In this systems, the scalar field plays the role of order parameter which is nonzero outside the monopole's core, where it is concentrated the main part of the monopole's energy.

Previous works that consider quantum fields in global monopole systems includes the analysis of massless scalar fields \cite{hiscock,mazzitely-lousto,bezerra1}, and the calculation of the quantum stress energy tensor for a massless spinor field \cite{bezerra2,bezerra3}.

In \cite{owenmonopole1}, we construct various approximations for $<\phi^{2}>$, each one proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $\left[a_{k}\right]$, starting from the leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{2}\right]$, up to the next to next to next to leading term, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $\left[a_{5}\right]$. In terms of the mass $\mu$ of the quantum scalar field, the leading approximation lead to $<\phi^{2}>$ proportional to $\mu^{-2}$, whereas the higher order approximation involve powers $\mu^{-8}$.  We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation.

The results obtained in \cite{owenmonopole1} for the field fluctuations of the quantized massive scalar field in the global monopole background shows that taking into account higher order terms substantially improve the approximation, for which we concluded that for this spacetimes, we need to use the next to next to next to leading term to obtain a good description of the vacuum polarization.

This situation was in contrast with that obtained for other spacetimes with spherical symmetry, as the one describing a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, for which previous studies showed that the next to leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{3}\right]$, provides a reasonable good approximation \cite{matyjasek4}.

In this paper we continue the study of vacuum polarization effects in the spacetime of the global monopole. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime. This expression, which is an expansion in powers of the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field, proportional to coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coefficient $\left[a_{3}\right]$, is used to obtain the leading approximation for the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor of the quantum field by functional differentiation with respect to the metric

Answer:

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a method used to calculate the effective action in quantum field theory in curved spacetime. It is named after Julian Schwinger and Bryce DeWitt, who developed the technique in the 1960s.

The effective action is a functional of the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ and matter fields, and it encodes all the quantum effects of the theory. In the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, one expands the effective action in a power series of the curvature tensor $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}$ and its derivatives. This expansion is known as the DeWitt expansion.

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach has been applied to various situations, such as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, quantum cosmology, and black hole thermodynamics. It has also been used to study the renormalization of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density in quantum gravity.

One of the main advantages of the Schwinger-DeWitt approach is that it allows for the calculation of the effective action in a manifestly covariant way. This is important in curved spacetime, where the metric tensor is not a constant but depends on the spacetime geometry.

In summary, the Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a method for calculating the effective action"

One of the unresolved problems in fundamental physics is the problem of the electron's internal structure.
In classical physics, this problem manifests itself in the fact that a point charge possesses an infinite mass related to the energy
of the electrostatic field created by the charge. In quantum electrodynamics, a point electron leads to the occurrence of divergences in loop graphs.

Apparently, a first attempt to resolve this problem has been made by Abraham and Lorentz within the theory of an electron suggested in Refs.~\cite{ablo,ablo1}.
Another attempt to resolve the problem is Wheeler's idea of `charge without charge'~\cite{wheelbook} where an electric charge is regarded as a
wormhole containing force lines of an electric field. Within such model, the region where the force lines enter the wormhole looks like a negative charge,
and the region where the force lines emerge from the wormhole mimics a positive charge. Also, numerous attempts have been made to find regular solutions
in classical and nonlinear electrodynamics both in the presence  and in the absence of the gravitational
field~\cite{Born:1934gh,heis,Markov:1970hv,Markov:1972sc,Bronnikov:1979ex,Datzeff:1980tg,Bonnor:1989iw,Davidson:1992kr,Herr:1994,Zaslavskii:2010yi,Finst:1999,Bronn:2000,Habib:2009,Zaslav:2010,Dzhunushaliev:2016bnh}.
One should also definitely mention the popular approach to the classical model of an electron using the Einstein-Dirac~\cite{Finster:1998ws}
and Kerr-Newman~\cite{KNold,KNold1,KNold2,KNold3,KNold4,KNold5,KNold6,KNold7} solutions (an extensive bibliography on the subject can be found in Ref.~\cite{Burinskii:2011id}).

In the present paper we consider a model of an electron on the assumption that its internal structure is determined by quantum gravitational effects.
We suppose that such effects can be approximately described by modified Weyl gravity suggested in Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.
This enables us to represent the electron as a composite object whose interior region is described by modified Weyl gravity and the exterior region~-- by Minkowski spacetime. In turn, in both regions, there is a Dirac spinor field that ensures the presence of a spin of $1/2$ in the system. To describe the interior region, we will use the solution obtained in  Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom} which is embedded in an exterior flat spacetime. In addition, notice that, since Weyl gravity (as well as modified Weyl gravity considered here) is conformally invariant, metrics differing by a conformal factor are the same solution. Physically this can be interpreted  as the presence in the interior region of fluctuations of the metric conformal factor

The research found that an innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers.

A similar inbuilt instinct may be the reason why girls have always liked to play with dolls, cosmetics or toys based on domestic life, it said.

An innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers

But the impact of feminism on parents, advertising and media may be a reason why girls have been less keen on dolls, make-up and kitchen toys in recent years, according to the research paper.

Girls are more likely than boys to be influenced as they grow up by parents, the adults and children around them, and what they read and see on television, it said, while boys stick to boys’ toys.

The study produced by a team led by psychologists from City, University of London, was based on evidence collected by different researchers across the Western world over decades, with some dating back to the 1930s.

It said: ‘Despite methodological variation in the choice and number of toys offered, context of testing, and age of child, the consistency in finding sex differences in children’s preferences for toys typed to their own gender indicates the strength of this phenomenon and the likelihood that it has a biological origin.’

The paper added that there were robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.

This, the study said, ‘indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.’

The findings come at a time of deepening controversy over the choice of toys made by children, and heightened awareness over transgender issues.

The study found that 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with more fashionable than traditional toys. Aeroplanes were popular, which may have been to do with Amelia Earhart (pictured) and other female aviators

Last week the Church of England told schools that in the interest of avoiding transgender bullying, teachers in its schools should ensure ‘a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment.’

The City study said that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.

In 1932, an experiment ‘found that girls played with a toy aeroplane for similar times to boys.’

This may have been because at the time ‘female aviators were in the news; Amy Johnson flew from England to Australia in 1930, and Amelia Earhart flew solo across the Atlantic in 1932.’

Some attempts to study children found that boys tended to play aggressively even if they were given traditional girls’ toys.

‘Other toys, not necessarily male-typed, can afford aggressive play,’ the study said.

In 1980, it said, one set of psychologists ‘noted in their observation that boys played with a toy food mixer as if it were a machine gun.’

In recent times, girls have been less likely to play with dolls and other toys once considered female.

‘One interpretation is that , over the years, girls have been exposed to increasing pressure to play with neutral-typed toys as the volume of advertising to children and expansion on the number and type of children’s media outlets have increased enormously,’ it said.

Dr Brenda Todd of City, University of London, said: ‘What we found is that as boys get older we see increased play with toys typed to their gender

","‘This suggests that the preference for toys typed to their gender is innate.

‘We also found that girls are more likely to be influenced by the environment around them, such as parents, advertising and media, to play with toys typed to other genders.

‘This suggests that the preference for toys typed to their gender is learned.’

The study said that there were ‘robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.

‘This indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.’

It said that the ‘strongest evidence for an innate preference’ came from the fact that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.

Answer:

I believe there are several factors that could contribute to this trend observed in boys' toy preferences as they get older. One possible reason could be socialization, as boys are exposed to certain types of toys and activities that are considered ""masculine"" from a young age. Additionally, gender stereotypes and societal expectations may also play a role in shaping boys' toy preferences. For example, boys may be more likely to choose toys that align with traditional gender roles and expectations, such as action figures, sports equipment, or building sets. This could be influenced by factors such as peer pressure, media representations, and the toys they see their friends or family members playing with."

\label{intro}

Gravitational accretion of matter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) that resides in the center of most, if not all, galaxies is what powers active galactic nuclei (AGN, \citealt{Rees84}). This very efficient process produces large amounts of energy across the entire spectrum that can be detected at cosmological distances. Not only is radiation emitted, but also large amounts of matter are injected back into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This process is known as feedback, and it is believed to play a major role in the coevolution of the SMBH and the galaxy (\citealt{DM05}; \citealt{HE10}).

More than half of the observed type-1 AGN present signatures of photoionized gas in their soft X-ray spectrum, the so-called warm absorbers (WA), that are seen as absorption features superimposed to the continuum (e.g., \citealt{Rey97}; \citealt{Geo98}; \citealt{Cre03}). With the advent of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy after the launch of {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and {\sl Chandra}{}, it was observed that these absorbers were blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of their host galaxy, typically by hundreds to thousands of km s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{Kaa00}; \citealt{Kas01}). Since they were outflowing, they were injecting kinetic energy and mass back into the ISM and therefore they were potential candidates to be a source of cosmic feedback. It is now considered that the regular WAs have, in general, little impact on their surroundings, with the exception of their most extreme version: outflows with very high velocity, ionization state, and column density, known as ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), which can have a significant impact on their host galaxy (\citealt{Tom12, Tom13}; \citealt{Laha16}).

The dominant launching mechanism of these outflows is still a matter of debate as they present a wide range of velocities, degrees of ionization, and column densities. They range from thermal winds arising the from inner edge of the torus, which is eroded by the intense radiation field (\citealt{KK01}), and winds launched from the accretion disk by radiative means (\citealt{PK04}) or magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms (\citealt{KK94}; \citealt{Fuk10a, Fuk10b}). In addition to this, after many years of observations and monitoring of AGN, another type of transient wind has been identified and studied: high-column density, fast, obscuring winds that eclipse the inner X-ray source of AGN on relatively short time scales. A number of objects have now shown this kind of transient phenomenon, for instance NGC 1365 (\citealt{Ris07}), Mrk 766 (\citealt{Ris11}), Mrk 335 (\citealt{Lon13, Lon19}), NGC 5548 (\citealt{Kaa14}), NGC 3783 (\citealt{Meh17}), and now also NGC 985 (\citealt{Ebr16}). 

NGC 985, also known as Mrk 1048, is a nearby ($z = 0.043$, \citealt{Fis95}), bright ($F_{\rm 0.3-10~keV} = 2.2 \times 10^{-11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, \citealt{Ebr16}) Seyfert 1 galaxy with a distinctive ring shape, produced by a recent galactic merger. This source is known to host a WA in X-rays (\citealt{Kro05,Kro09}) as well as an UV absorber (\citealt{Ara02}). During a {\sl Swift}{}~monitoring program in 2013, the source was found to be in a very low soft X-ray flux state. A triggered joint {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST observation found that some intervening very dense gas was occulting the central X-ray source (\citealt{Par14}). In the most recent observations in 2015, taken 12 days apart also with {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST, we found that the source was emerging from this obscured state. The first analysis of the X-ray broad band and UV spectra were presented in \citet{Ebr16}

The observations were taken with the {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS cameras in Small Window mode, with the source in the field of view of the pn camera and the MOS cameras. The pn camera was operated in timing mode with the optical blocking filter in place, and the MOS cameras were operated in full frame mode. The observations were taken in the 2015 campaign, with the first observation on 2015-04-21 14:18:34 UT and the second one on 2015-04-30 13:52:02 UT. The exposure times were 12.4~ks and 13.1~ks, respectively. The data were processed with the Science Analysis System (SAS) v.15.0.0, using the standard procedures.

Answer:<|model|> Ebrero et al. (2016) analyzed both the X-ray broad band and UV spectra to gain insights into the physical processes during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN.

Step 1: Understand the nature of the data.

X-ray broad band and UV spectra are two types of electromagnetic radiation that are emitted by celestial objects. X-rays are high-energy radiation, while UV radiation lies between visible light and X-rays on the electromagnetic spectrum.

Step 2: Identify the properties of the data.

X-ray broad band spectra provide information about the energy distribution of X-rays emitted by an object. UV spectra, on the other hand, reveal the wavelength distribution of UV radiation emitted by the same object.

Step 3: Explain the significance of the data.

By analyzing both X-ray broad band and UV spectra, Ebrero et al. (2016) were able to study the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN. The X-ray data can reveal information about the structure and activity of the central supermassive black hole, while the UV data can provide insights"

Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

Answer:
X-ray broad band and UV spectra provide unique information about the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy. The X-ray broad band spectrum captures the energy distribution of X-ray photons emitted by the AGN, which can reveal information about the properties of the accretion disk, outflows, and jets. The UV spectrum, on the other hand, captures the energy distribution of UV photons emitted by the AGN, which can provide insights into the properties of the dust and gas in the host galaxy and the ionizing radiation from the AGN.

Studying these two spectral bands together allows researchers to investigate the physical processes at work during this transition. The X-ray spectrum can provide information about the changing accretion rate and outflow properties, while the UV spectrum can reveal changes in the dust content and ionizing radiation. This combination of information allows researchers to gain a more complete understanding of the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy.

Additionally, these spectral bands can be studied over time to monitor the progression of the transition and provide insights into the timescales of these processes. In contrast, other observational techniques, such as imaging or photometry, may not capture the full range of physical processes involved"

","Question:How does the decrease in X-ray absorption and increase in UV emission observed by Ebrero et al. (2016) during the transition of the active galaxy from an obscured to an unobscured state relate to the physics driving these changes?
Answer:The decrease in X-ray absorption and increase in UV emission observed by Ebrero et al. (2016) during the transition of the active galaxy from an obscured to an unobscured state can be related to the physics driving these changes in several ways. First, the decrease in X-ray absorption suggests that the obscuring material surrounding the central supermassive black hole is being cleared away, allowing for more direct viewing of the AGN. This could be due to a reduction in the amount of obscuring material or a change in its structure, which would allow for more direct viewing of the AGN.

The increase in UV emission, on the other hand, could be due to an enhancement in the accretion rate onto the black hole. As the AGN transitions from an obscured to an unobscured state, the accretion rate may increase, leading to a higher UV luminosity. This increase in accretion rate could be due to a variety of factors, such as changes in the accretion disk structure, the presence of an additional source of fuel for"

The first analysis of both the X-ray broad band and UV spectra was presented in an article by Ebrero et al. (2016), providing important insights into the complex physical processes at play during this transition.
Previous Question 
Question:What type of data did Ebrero et al. (2016) analyze to gain insights into the physical processes during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN?
Answer:Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
Ebrero et al. (2016) analyzed data from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to gain insights into the physical processes during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN.
Step 2: Understand what is being asked.
The question asks about the type of data that was analyzed by Ebrero et al. (2016) to understand this transition.
Step 3: Provide a clear answer.
Ebrero et al. (2016) used X-ray broad band and UV spectra obtained from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to analyze and gain insights into the physical processes occurring during this transition.
Therefore, my answer would be:
'Ebrero et al. (2016) analyzed X-ray broad band and UV spectra obtained from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to gain insights into the physical processes taking place as an active galaxy undergoes a transformation from an obscured state to an unobscured state.'
Question:Sure! Here's a question based on the previous context and questions:
'Can you elaborate on why studying X-ray broad band and UV spectra are particularly important for understanding the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to unobscured active galaxy, as demonstrated by Ebrero et al. (2016)? What unique information do these two spectral bands provide that other observational techniques may not capture?'
Answer:What are some other important insights or findings that Ebrero et al. (2016) presented in their article regarding the transition of the active galaxy from an obscured to an unobscured state?

 In addition to analyzing the X-ray broad band and UV spectra, Ebrero et al. (2016) also reported on several other significant findings related to the transition of the active galaxy. They observed a decrease in X-ray absorption, indicating a reduction in obscuring material surrounding the central supermassive black hole. The researchers also noted an increase in UV emission, suggesting an enhancement in the accretion rate onto the black hole during this transformation. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex physical processes occurring during this transition and contribute to our understanding of how active galaxies evolve over time.
Question:Sure thing! Based on the last piece, here are the major takeaways in tweet format:

🔥 Key findings: Ebrero et al. (2016) studied an active galaxy's transition from obscurbed to unobscured state using XMM-Newton & HST observations. Their study revealed a decrease in X-ray absorption, accompanied by an increase in UV emission, indicating enhanced accretion onto the SMBH. #astronomy #activegalaxies

Or if you prefer more bullet points:
• Decrease in X-ray absorption
• Increase in UV emission
• Enhanced accretion onto the SMBH

These findings highlight the importance of observing active galaxies across multiple wavelengths and spectrum to gain insights into their evolutionary states and physics driving those changes!
Answer:Major takeaways:
* Decrease in X-ray absorption
* Increase in UV emission
* Enhanced accretion onto SMBH
These findings show importance of observing active galaxies across spectrum to understand their evolutionary states and physics driving changes.

Question:Sure! Here's a thought-provoking question based on the context and previous answers:

""Given that the decreased X-ray absorption and increased UV emission during the transformation from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy suggest a change in the accretion mechanism, do you think there could be any implications for our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and coevolution with their host galaxies?""
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

Answer:The transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy, as observed by Ebrero et al. (2016), suggests a change in the accretion mechanism of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the galaxy's core. This change could have implications for our understanding of SMBH growth and coevolution with their host galaxies.

First, the decrease in X-ray absorption indicates a reduction in the amount of obscuring material surrounding the SMBH. This could suggest that the accretion process has shifted from a low-luminosity, optically thick state to a high-luminosity, optically thin state. In this scenario, the SMBH may be experiencing a period of increased accretion rate, potentially fueling its growth.

Second, the increase in UV emission suggests an enhancement in the accretion rate onto the SMBH. This could be due to the SMBH consuming more matter at a faster rate, leading to a more efficient accretion process. This increased accretion rate could have implications for the SMBH's growth and the overall energy output of the active galaxy.

These findings provide valuable insights into the complex physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy. However, further"

Fourteen primary and intermediate schools in the area have teamed up with a local trust to create the programme Fuel the Need.

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

Fuel the Need is being run by Manuel Dalton, who runs the Dalton's Gym Charitable Trust, which in turn operates a community based gym in Upper Hutt City.

Mr Dalton is a self-described Upper Hutt boy, an ex-soldier with a philanthropic drive to help out the community where he was born and bred.

At the end of 2014 he met with principals from schools in the region so they could work out what the need was. The group deduced about 50 children a day were turning up to school without lunch, although he believed that could be on the conservative side.

""To me that was a big enough number to prompt me to do something about it.""

Mr Dalton immediately got to work, getting the gym's chiller reinstated, having two people get food handling and hygeine certificates and getting approval in principle from the council to run the operations.

There is a database of about 20 people willing to volunteer their time to the programme, and a deal has been struck with Pak 'n Save to supply the food at $3 per lunch which includes a sandwich, yoghurt, and piece of fruit and a museli bar.

The programme needs about $30,000 a year funding. Mr Dalton has sent about 300 emails to local businesses, but has had only had two replies - both of which were a 'thanks, but no thanks'.

Mr Dalton said the response was disappointing and he planned to make further contact with businesses.

""I'm not trying to sound harsh but if there are businesses that are making money off our community then I'm sort of garnering towards making them socially responsible to give back to the community that it makes money from.""

Trentham School is one of the schools that would benefit from the initiative.

The decile 5 primary school has about 406 pupils for whom many English is a second language.

Trentham's principal Suzanne Su'a said every week a handful of pupils turn up with empty stomachs and nothing for the day which has an impact on their learning and behaviour.

""For us to not have food at home that you can bring to school is a real concern, you know we deal with the five days a week, there's still the weekend.""

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

At the beginning of every term the school makes sandwiches that it freezes and then defrosts when they are needed, but the school hopes the Fuel the Need initiative will supplement that.

Mrs Su'a said the number of children in need varies year from year. She describes it as quite a transient school with pupils coming in who will leave part way through the year, and others that return.

She said the school does not have hard data on why the children may not have food, but the teachers make judgements through observation and sometimes what the children say.

""For some it's purely just lack of money and trying to make their weekly budget stretch through, sometimes you can tell on certain days when kids don't have lunch, the benefit might not come through until the next couple of days so for a lot of our families it is to do with financial poverty, and then we might have some families who it comes down to poor management by parents in regards to finances.""

Mrs Su'a was disappointed by the response from local businesses - as was the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce which worked with Mr Dalton to help get the initiative off the ground.

Chief executive Mark Futter said it was a great concept and he was astounded no businesses had come forward to help.

""I'm genuinely surprised to be perfectly honest

\label{intro_sec}

One of the most long-standing puzzles in stellar astrophysics is represented by 
the observed dichotomy in the mean period of globular cluster (GC) RR Lyrae 
variables pulsating in their fundamental mode (RR0). This evidence, first discovery 
by Grosse (1932) and Hachenberg (1939), was studied by Oosterhoff (1939, 
1944) who noted that GCs can be divided in two groups according to the mean
period of their RR0 variables: a first group with
$\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.55~d$ (OoI) and a second group of clusters with significantly 
longer mean periods $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.65~d$ (OoII). Kinman (1959) noticed that the
subdivision of the two groups correlates with the clusters' metal content with 
the OoI group constituted by relatively
metal-rich ($-1.6<[Fe/H]<-1.0$) clusters and the OoII group comprising the most 
metal-poor ones ($[Fe/H]<-1.6$). Clusters of the two groups have also
differences in their relative fraction of first overtone (RR1) pulsator and
different horizontal branch (HB) morphologies (Stobie 1971).
A third group (OoIII) populated by two very metal-rich clusters ($[Fe/H]\sim-0.45$; 
NGC6388 and NGC6441)
which exhibit a long $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.75~d$ has been later defined (Pritzl et al.
2000). Only few clusters have a mean RR0 
period in the intermediate range $0.58<\langle P_{ab}\rangle<0.62$ (the
so-called ""Oosterhoff gap""). Although at the epoch of the original
discovery of the Oosterhoff dichotomy, the surveys of variable stars were limited to only 5 
GCs, its significance has been confirmed
in the subsequent years when large samples of RR0 have been observed in many GCs. 
The same behavior has been observed among field RR0 populating the Galactic halo
(Sandage 1982a; Suntzeff, Kinman \& Kraft 1991; Miceli et al. 2008; Szczygie{\l}, Pojma{\'n}ski \& Pilecki 2009).
For decades the true nature of the Oosterhoff dichotomy has been debated
and many solutions have been proposed (see Catelan 2009 for a recent review). 
The first attempts to interpret this evidence focused their attention on the
temperature of the edges of the instability strip (Schwarzschild 1957) and on 
the mean luminosity of the HB (Sandage 1957)

","\section{Discussion}
\label{disc_sec}

The fact that the RR0 variables in GCs and in the field have the same mean period 
and that the RR0 period is correlated with the cluster's metallicity,
suggests that the observed dichotomy is related to the clusters'
chemical composition. The chemical evolution of GCs is driven by the 
infall of primordial gas, the ejection of low-mass stars, the mass-loss 
from the most massive stars and the ejection of high-mass stars (e.g.
Bekki \& Freeman 2003). The chemical enrichment of GCs is also affected by the 
ejection of massive stars and by the accretion of gas-rich dwarf galaxies
(e.g. Bekki \& Freeman 2003). The first group of clusters (OoI)
is formed by the most metal-rich ones and the second group (OoII) by the most 
metal-poor ones. The RR0 period is correlated with the cluster's metallicity 
and the dichotomy is a consequence of the chemical evolution of GCs.

The Oosterhoff dichotomy is a classification system for globular clusters based on the pulsating periods of their RR Lyrae variable stars, particularly those in their fundamental mode (RR0). It divides these clusters into two main groups, Oosterhoff I (OoI) and Oosterhoff II (OoII), with distinct mean periods of these pulsators.
