Quantum Field theory in curved spacetime is a well-established branch of modern physics, which has allowed the achievement of novel results since Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation \cite{Hawking}. Within this framework, we consider the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, considered as a classical external field. That is, all matter fields are considered using quantum field theory, with the only exception of the external gravitational field, that remains satisfying the classical Einstein field equations of General Relativity \cite{DeWitt,birrel}.

In this context, an important role is played by the quantum stress energy tensor \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) of the quantum field, which is used as a source in the so called semiclassical Einstein's equations to take a look at the quantum corrections to the background geometry caused by the quantization of matter fields \cite{birrel,york,lousto-sanchez}. For this reason, it is very useful to have explicit analytical expressions for the renormalized stress tensor. This quantum stress tensor and the expectation value of the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) of a quantum field \(\varphi\) are the main objects to be determined from quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

The exact determination of \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) for a generic spacetime is very cumbersome, and some techniques have been developed and applied to this problem, including numerical ones \cite{candelas,koffman,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,owen1,owen2,Folacci,FT}. However, for the case of massive fields, there exist a method, called the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action approach, in which one assumes that the vacuum polarization effects can be separated from the particle creation, for masses of the fields sufficiently large. This method allow us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action as an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. From the effective action, the quantum stress energy tensor can be calculated by functional differentiation with respect to the metric. This approach, based on proper time expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field, can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds, whenever the Compton's wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature \cite{DeWitt,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,popov,owen1,owen2,Folacci}.

In a previous paper \cite{owenmonopole1} we took the first step in the investigation of vacuum polarization effects of quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a point-like global monopole, using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique to obtain analytical expressions for the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) in this background spacetime. We used the simple model, discovered by Barriola and Vilenkin \cite{barriola-vilenkin}, which leads to global monopoles as heavy objects appeared in the early universe as a result of a phase transition of a self-coupled scalar field triplet whose original global $O(3)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)$. In this systems, the scalar field plays the role of order parameter which is nonzero outside the monopole's core, where it is concentrated the main part of the monopole's energy.

Previous works that consider quantum fields in global monopole systems includes the analysis of massless scalar fields \cite{hiscock,mazzitely-lousto,bezerra1}, and the calculation of the quantum stress energy tensor for a massless spinor field \cite{bezerra2,bezerra3}.

In \cite{owenmonopole1}, we construct various approximations for $<\phi^{2}>$, each one proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $\left[a_{k}\right]$, starting from the leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{2}\right]$, up to the next to next to next to leading term, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $\left[a_{5}\right]$. In terms of the mass $\mu$ of the quantum scalar field, the leading approximation lead to $<\phi^{2}>$ proportional to $\mu^{-2}$, whereas the higher order approximation involve powers $\mu^{-8}$.  We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation.

The results obtained in \cite{owenmonopole1} for the field fluctuations of the quantized massive scalar field in the global monopole background shows that taking into account higher order terms substantially improve the approximation, for which we concluded that for this spacetimes, we need to use the next to next to next to leading term to obtain a good description of the vacuum polarization.

This situation was in contrast with that obtained for other spacetimes with spherical symmetry, as the one describing a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, for which previous studies showed that the next to leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{3}\right]$, provides a reasonable good approximation \cite{matyjasek4}.

In this paper we continue the study of vacuum polarization effects in the spacetime of the global monopole. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime. This expression, which is an expansion in powers of the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field, proportional to coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coefficient $\left[a_{3}\right]$, is used to obtain the leading approximation for the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor of the quantum field by functional differentiation with respect to the metric

\section{The quantum effective action}

We consider a quantum massive scalar field $\phi$ with mass $\mu$ and a generic background spacetime $g_{\mu\nu}$. We assume that the field is coupled to the spacetime through a general Lagrangian density $L(\phi,g_{\mu\nu})$, with a coupling constant $\lambda$ and a potential $V(\phi)$.

The Euclidean action of the theory is

\begin{equation}
S = \int d^{4}x \sqrt{-g} \left( \frac{1}{2} \left[ g^{\mu\nu} \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial_{\nu} \phi + \lambda \phi^2 R + \lambda \phi V(\phi) \right] + \frac{1}{4} \lambda \phi^2 R^2 \"

Answer:

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a method for calculating the one-loop quantum effective action in curved spacetime. It involves expanding the quantum effective action in a power series of the curvature tensor, and then evaluating the coefficients of this expansion using Feynman diagrams.

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is useful for studying vacuum polarization effects of massive fields in curved backgrounds. For example, it can be used to calculate the one-loop quantum corrections to the effective action of a scalar field in a gravitational field. These corrections can then be used to study the renormalization of the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant, as well as to obtain the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the scalar field.

In summary, the Schwinger-DeWitt approach provides a systematic method for calculating the one-loop quantum effective action in curved spacetime, which is particularly useful for studying vacuum polarization effects of massive fields in gravitational fields."

Comment:

Answer: The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a method for calculating the one-loop quantum effective action in curved spacetime. It involves expanding the effective action around a given background metric and then evaluating the resulting perturbation series. This approach allows for the calculation of vacuum polarization effects of massive fields in curved backgrounds.

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach begins by expanding the effective action around a given background metric $g_{\mu\nu}$:

$\Gamma[\phi] = \Gamma[\phi]^0 + \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \phi^{a} \delta^2 \Gamma_{abcd} \phi^{b} \phi^{c} \phi^{d} + \cdots \right]$

Where $\Gamma[\phi]^0$ is the classical action and $\delta^2 \Gamma_{abcd}$ is the second variation of the effective action with respect to the background metric. The first term in the expansion represents the vacuum polarization of the field, which arises from the interaction of the field with the background curvature.

The second variation of the effective action can be computed using the background metric and the equations of motion for the field. This yields a set of equations that must be solved for the coefficients of the expansion.

In the present paper we consider a model of an electron on the assumption that its internal structure is determined by quantum gravitational effects.
We suppose that such effects can be approximately described by modified Weyl gravity suggested in Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.
This enables us to represent the electron as a composite object whose interior region is described by modified Weyl gravity and the exterior region~-- by Minkowski spacetime. In turn, in both regions, there is a Dirac spinor field that ensures the presence of a spin of $1/2$ in the system. To describe the interior region, we will use the solution obtained in  Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom} which is embedded in an exterior flat spacetime. In addition, notice that, since Weyl gravity (as well as modified Weyl gravity considered here) is conformally invariant, metrics differing by a conformal factor are the same solution. Physically this can be interpreted  as the presence in the interior region of fluctuations of the metric conformal factor

The problem of the electron's internal structure has been one of the unresolved problems in fundamental physics.

Answer:The proposed framework for understanding the internal structure of electrons using Modified Weyl Gravity can be extended to other fundamental particles by considering the role of quantum gravitational effects in their interactions and properties. This approach could reveal new insights into the relationships between different particles and their connections to gravity.

By examining the internal structure of other fundamental particles, such as quarks and neutrinos, through the lens of Modified Weyl Gravity, physicists may gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between particles and gravity at the quantum level. This could lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces that govern the universe and the nature of the cosmos.

Additionally, extending the framework to other particles may help identify commonalities and differences in their internal structures, providing valuable information about the underlying principles that govern the universe. This knowledge could be crucial for advancing our understanding of the universe and developing new technologies based on this understanding."

The research found that an innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers.

A similar inbuilt instinct may be the reason why girls have always liked to play with dolls, cosmetics or toys based on domestic life, it said.

An innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers

But the impact of feminism on parents, advertising and media may be a reason why girls have been less keen on dolls, make-up and kitchen toys in recent years, according to the research paper.

Girls are more likely than boys to be influenced as they grow up by parents, the adults and children around them, and what they read and see on television, it said, while boys stick to boys’ toys.

The study produced by a team led by psychologists from City, University of London, was based on evidence collected by different researchers across the Western world over decades, with some dating back to the 1930s.

It said: ‘Despite methodological variation in the choice and number of toys offered, context of testing, and age of child, the consistency in finding sex differences in children’s preferences for toys typed to their own gender indicates the strength of this phenomenon and the likelihood that it has a biological origin.’

The paper added that there were robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.

This, the study said, ‘indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.’

The findings come at a time of deepening controversy over the choice of toys made by children, and heightened awareness over transgender issues.

The study found that 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with more fashionable than traditional toys. Aeroplanes were popular, which may have been to do with Amelia Earhart (pictured) and other female aviators

Last week the Church of England told schools that in the interest of avoiding transgender bullying, teachers in its schools should ensure ‘a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment.’

The City study said that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.

In 1932, an experiment ‘found that girls played with a toy aeroplane for similar times to boys.’

This may have been because at the time ‘female aviators were in the news; Amy Johnson flew from England to Australia in 1930, and Amelia Earhart flew solo across the Atlantic in 1932.’

Some attempts to study children found that boys tended to play aggressively even if they were given traditional girls’ toys.

‘Other toys, not necessarily male-typed, can afford aggressive play,’ the study said.

In 1980, it said, one set of psychologists ‘noted in their observation that boys played with a toy food mixer as if it were a machine gun.’

In recent times, girls have been less likely to play with dolls and other toys once considered female.

‘One interpretation is that , over the years, girls have been exposed to increasing pressure to play with neutral-typed toys as the volume of advertising to children and expansion on the number and type of children’s media outlets have increased enormously,’ it said.

Dr Brenda Todd of City, University of London, said: ‘What we found is that as boys get older we see increased play with toys typed to their gender

","‘This suggests that, as children get older, they become more influenced by the environment around them.

‘Girls, on the other hand, show a decrease in the amount of time they play with toys typed to their gender as they get older.

‘This suggests that, as children get older, they become less influenced by the environment around them.’

She added: ‘We know that the sexes are different, and this is the first time that anyone has looked at the way that boys and girls play with toys.

‘It is important to understand that the sexes are different because we can then start to understand why that is, and how to support them in the best way.’

The study was published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.

Answer:

The trend of boys playing more with traditional masculine toys as they get older could be due to a variety of factors. One possible explanation is that as boys mature, they may become more interested in exploring and developing their masculine identity. This could include playing with toys that are traditionally associated with masculinity, such as action figures, sports equipment, or construction sets.

Another reason could be the influence of social norms and expectations. As boys grow older, they may be more influenced by societal expectations of what it means to be masculine. This could lead them to gravitate towards toys and activities that are considered masculine, in order to conform to these expectations.

Additionally, it is possible that as boys get older, they may have more opportunities to engage in activities and play with toys that are traditionally associated with their gender. For example, they may be able to participate in sports teams or clubs, or have access to more advanced construction sets or tools.

In conclusion, the trend of boys playing more with traditional masculine toys as they get older could be due to a combination of factors, including the development of their masculine identity, social norms and expectations, and increased opportunities for participation in activities and play."

The trend observed in boys' toy preferences as they get older could have several implications for parents and caregivers. Firstly, it may require parents to be more aware of the types of toys their sons are playing with and the messages these toys may be sending about gender roles and expectations. Additionally, parents may need to consider how their choices of toys for their sons may reinforce or challenge societal norms around masculinity.

\label{intro}

Gravitational accretion of matter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) that resides in the center of most, if not all, galaxies is what powers active galactic nuclei (AGN, \citealt{Rees84}). This very efficient process produces large amounts of energy across the entire spectrum that can be detected at cosmological distances. Not only is radiation emitted, but also large amounts of matter are injected back into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This process is known as feedback, and it is believed to play a major role in the coevolution of the SMBH and the galaxy (\citealt{DM05}; \citealt{HE10}).

More than half of the observed type-1 AGN present signatures of photoionized gas in their soft X-ray spectrum, the so-called warm absorbers (WA), that are seen as absorption features superimposed to the continuum (e.g., \citealt{Rey97}; \citealt{Geo98}; \citealt{Cre03}). With the advent of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy after the launch of {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and {\sl Chandra}{}, it was observed that these absorbers were blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of their host galaxy, typically by hundreds to thousands of km s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{Kaa00}; \citealt{Kas01}). Since they were outflowing, they were injecting kinetic energy and mass back into the ISM and therefore they were potential candidates to be a source of cosmic feedback. It is now considered that the regular WAs have, in general, little impact on their surroundings, with the exception of their most extreme version: outflows with very high velocity, ionization state, and column density, known as ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), which can have a significant impact on their host galaxy (\citealt{Tom12, Tom13}; \citealt{Laha16}).

The dominant launching mechanism of these outflows is still a matter of debate as they present a wide range of velocities, degrees of ionization, and column densities. They range from thermal winds arising the from inner edge of the torus, which is eroded by the intense radiation field (\citealt{KK01}), and winds launched from the accretion disk by radiative means (\citealt{PK04}) or magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms (\citealt{KK94}; \citealt{Fuk10a, Fuk10b}). In addition to this, after many years of observations and monitoring of AGN, another type of transient wind has been identified and studied: high-column density, fast, obscuring winds that eclipse the inner X-ray source of AGN on relatively short time scales. A number of objects have now shown this kind of transient phenomenon, for instance NGC 1365 (\citealt{Ris07}), Mrk 766 (\citealt{Ris11}), Mrk 335 (\citealt{Lon13, Lon19}), NGC 5548 (\citealt{Kaa14}), NGC 3783 (\citealt{Meh17}), and now also NGC 985 (\citealt{Ebr16}). 

NGC 985, also known as Mrk 1048, is a nearby ($z = 0.043$, \citealt{Fis95}), bright ($F_{\rm 0.3-10~keV} = 2.2 \times 10^{-11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, \citealt{Ebr16}) Seyfert 1 galaxy with a distinctive ring shape, produced by a recent galactic merger. This source is known to host a WA in X-rays (\citealt{Kro05,Kro09}) as well as an UV absorber (\citealt{Ara02}). During a {\sl Swift}{}~monitoring program in 2013, the source was found to be in a very low soft X-ray flux state. A triggered joint {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST observation found that some intervening very dense gas was occulting the central X-ray source (\citealt{Par14}). In the most recent observations in 2015, taken 12 days apart also with {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST, we found that the source was emerging from this obscured state. The first analysis of the X-ray broad band and UV spectra were presented in \citet{Ebr16}

Answer:Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
The question asks for an explanation of why studying X-ray broad band and UV spectra is important for understanding the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to unobscured active galaxy, as demonstrated by Ebrero et al. (2016).

Step 3: Provide a clear answer.
Studying X-ray broad band and UV spectra is important for understanding the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to unobscured active galaxy because they provide unique information about the emission from the accretion disk and the obscuring torus.

In particular, X-rays are emitted from the accretion disk and provide information about the structure and dynamics of the disk itself, as well as the amount of material being accreted onto the supermassive black hole. The UV spectrum, on the other hand, is emitted from the obscuring torus and can reveal the density, temperature, and ionization state of the gas within the torus.

Answer:
Studying X-ray broad band and UV spectra are particularly important for understanding the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to unobscured active galaxy because they provide unique information that other observational techniques may not capture. X-ray broad band spectra can reveal the amount of absorption and emission from the active galaxy, which can help determine the structure and properties of the surrounding material and the accretion rate onto the central supermassive black hole. UV spectra, on the other hand, can provide information about the ionizing radiation and the ionization state of the surrounding gas, which can help understand the nature of the obscuring material and its evolution during the transition.

Answer:What are some other important insights or findings that Ebrero et al. (2016) presented in their article regarding the transition of the active galaxy from an obscured to an unobscured state?

 In addition to analyzing the X-ray broad band and UV spectra, Ebrero et al. (2016) also reported on several other significant findings related to the transition of the active galaxy. They observed a decrease in X-ray absorption, indicating a reduction in obscuring material surrounding the central supermassive black hole. The researchers also noted an increase in UV emission, suggesting an enhancement in the accretion rate onto the black hole during this transformation. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex physical processes occurring during this transition and contribute to our understanding of how active galaxies evolve over time.

""Given that the decreased X-ray absorption and increased UV emission during the transformation from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy suggest a change in the accretion mechanism, do you think there could be any implications for our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and coevolution with their host galaxies?""
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

Answer:Sure thing! Based on the context and previous answers, I would say that the implications of the decreased X-ray absorption and increased UV emission during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy could indeed have significant implications for our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and coevolution with their host galaxies.

First, the decrease in X-ray absorption indicates a reduction in obscuring material surrounding the central supermassive black hole. This suggests that the accretion mechanism may be changing from a more obscured, advection-dominated flow to a less obscured, radiatively efficient flow. This transition could provide valuable insights into the different stages of supermassive black hole growth and the factors that drive these changes.

Second, the increase in UV emission suggests an enhancement in the accretion rate onto the black hole during this transformation. This increase in accretion rate could potentially lead to a faster growth rate of the supermassive black hole, which could have implications for the overall evolution of the host galaxy. It could also provide information on the role of accretion in shaping the properties of galaxies and their evolution over time.

In summary, the findings from Ebrero et al. (2016) regarding the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy could help us better understand"

Fourteen primary and intermediate schools in the area have teamed up with a local trust to create the programme Fuel the Need.

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

Fuel the Need is being run by Manuel Dalton, who runs the Dalton's Gym Charitable Trust, which in turn operates a community based gym in Upper Hutt City.

Mr Dalton is a self-described Upper Hutt boy, an ex-soldier with a philanthropic drive to help out the community where he was born and bred.

At the end of 2014 he met with principals from schools in the region so they could work out what the need was. The group deduced about 50 children a day were turning up to school without lunch, although he believed that could be on the conservative side.

""To me that was a big enough number to prompt me to do something about it.""

Mr Dalton immediately got to work, getting the gym's chiller reinstated, having two people get food handling and hygeine certificates and getting approval in principle from the council to run the operations.

There is a database of about 20 people willing to volunteer their time to the programme, and a deal has been struck with Pak 'n Save to supply the food at $3 per lunch which includes a sandwich, yoghurt, and piece of fruit and a museli bar.

The programme needs about $30,000 a year funding. Mr Dalton has sent about 300 emails to local businesses, but has had only had two replies - both of which were a 'thanks, but no thanks'.

Mr Dalton said the response was disappointing and he planned to make further contact with businesses.

""I'm not trying to sound harsh but if there are businesses that are making money off our community then I'm sort of garnering towards making them socially responsible to give back to the community that it makes money from.""

Trentham School is one of the schools that would benefit from the initiative.

The decile 5 primary school has about 406 pupils for whom many English is a second language.

Trentham's principal Suzanne Su'a said every week a handful of pupils turn up with empty stomachs and nothing for the day which has an impact on their learning and behaviour.

""For us to not have food at home that you can bring to school is a real concern, you know we deal with the five days a week, there's still the weekend.""

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

At the beginning of every term the school makes sandwiches that it freezes and then defrosts when they are needed, but the school hopes the Fuel the Need initiative will supplement that.

Mrs Su'a said the number of children in need varies year from year. She describes it as quite a transient school with pupils coming in who will leave part way through the year, and others that return.

She said the school does not have hard data on why the children may not have food, but the teachers make judgements through observation and sometimes what the children say.

""For some it's purely just lack of money and trying to make their weekly budget stretch through, sometimes you can tell on certain days when kids don't have lunch, the benefit might not come through until the next couple of days so for a lot of our families it is to do with financial poverty, and then we might have some families who it comes down to poor management by parents in regards to finances.""

Mrs Su'a was disappointed by the response from local businesses - as was the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce which worked with Mr Dalton to help get the initiative off the ground.

Chief executive Mark Futter said it was a great concept and he was astounded no businesses had come forward to help.

""I'm genuinely surprised to be perfectly honest

\label{intro_sec}

One of the most long-standing puzzles in stellar astrophysics is represented by 
the observed dichotomy in the mean period of globular cluster (GC) RR Lyrae 
variables pulsating in their fundamental mode (RR0). This evidence, first discovery 
by Grosse (1932) and Hachenberg (1939), was studied by Oosterhoff (1939, 
1944) who noted that GCs can be divided in two groups according to the mean
period of their RR0 variables: a first group with
$\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.55~d$ (OoI) and a second group of clusters with significantly 
longer mean periods $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.65~d$ (OoII). Kinman (1959) noticed that the
subdivision of the two groups correlates with the clusters' metal content with 
the OoI group constituted by relatively
metal-rich ($-1.6<[Fe/H]<-1.0$) clusters and the OoII group comprising the most 
metal-poor ones ($[Fe/H]<-1.6$). Clusters of the two groups have also
differences in their relative fraction of first overtone (RR1) pulsator and
different horizontal branch (HB) morphologies (Stobie 1971).
A third group (OoIII) populated by two very metal-rich clusters ($[Fe/H]\sim-0.45$; 
NGC6388 and NGC6441)
which exhibit a long $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.75~d$ has been later defined (Pritzl et al.
2000). Only few clusters have a mean RR0 
period in the intermediate range $0.58<\langle P_{ab}\rangle<0.62$ (the
so-called ""Oosterhoff gap""). Although at the epoch of the original
discovery of the Oosterhoff dichotomy, the surveys of variable stars were limited to only 5 
GCs, its significance has been confirmed
in the subsequent years when large samples of RR0 have been observed in many GCs. 
The same behavior has been observed among field RR0 populating the Galactic halo
(Sandage 1982a; Suntzeff, Kinman \& Kraft 1991; Miceli et al. 2008; Szczygie{\l}, Pojma{\'n}ski \& Pilecki 2009).
For decades the true nature of the Oosterhoff dichotomy has been debated
and many solutions have been proposed (see Catelan 2009 for a recent review). 
The first attempts to interpret this evidence focused their attention on the
temperature of the edges of the instability strip (Schwarzschild 1957) and on 
the mean luminosity of the HB (Sandage 1957)

","The second attempt to explain the dichotomy was based on the different 
mean metallicity of the two groups (Kinman 1959). The third hypothesis
was that the dichotomy could be due to the different mean mass of the two 
groups of clusters (Sandage 1972). The fourth attempt was based on the 
different mean age of the two groups (Sandage \&
Gedalla 1978). The fifth hypothesis was that the dichotomy could be due to 
different mean distance of the two groups of clusters (Sandage 1982a). The 
sixth attempt was based on the different mean period of the RR1 variables 
pulsating in their fundamental mode (Sandage 1982b). The seventh attempt was 
based on the different mean period of the RR1 variables pulsating in their 
first overtone mode (Sandage 1982a). The eighth attempt was based on the 
different mean period of the RR1 variables pulsating in their second 
overtone mode (Sandage 1982a). The ninth attempt was based on the different 
mean period of the RR1 variables pulsating in their third overtone mode

The Oosterhoff dichotomy is a classification system for globular clusters based on the pulsating periods of their RR Lyrae variable stars, particularly those in their fundamental mode (RR0). It divides these clusters into two main groups, Oosterhoff I (OoI) and Oosterhoff II (OoII), with distinct mean periods of these pulsators.
