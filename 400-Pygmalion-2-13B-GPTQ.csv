Quantum Field theory in curved spacetime is a well-established branch of modern physics, which has allowed the achievement of novel results since Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation \cite{Hawking}. Within this framework, we consider the quantum dynamics of fields in a gravitational background, considered as a classical external field. That is, all matter fields are considered using quantum field theory, with the only exception of the external gravitational field, that remains satisfying the classical Einstein field equations of General Relativity \cite{DeWitt,birrel}.

In this context, an important role is played by the quantum stress energy tensor \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) of the quantum field, which is used as a source in the so called semiclassical Einstein's equations to take a look at the quantum corrections to the background geometry caused by the quantization of matter fields \cite{birrel,york,lousto-sanchez}. For this reason, it is very useful to have explicit analytical expressions for the renormalized stress tensor. This quantum stress tensor and the expectation value of the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) of a quantum field \(\varphi\) are the main objects to be determined from quantum field theory in curved spacetime.

The exact determination of \(\langle T_{\mu}^{\nu}\rangle\) for a generic spacetime is very cumbersome, and some techniques have been developed and applied to this problem, including numerical ones \cite{candelas,koffman,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,owen1,owen2,Folacci,FT}. However, for the case of massive fields, there exist a method, called the Schwinger-DeWitt effective action approach, in which one assumes that the vacuum polarization effects can be separated from the particle creation, for masses of the fields sufficiently large. This method allow us to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action as an expansion in the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field. From the effective action, the quantum stress energy tensor can be calculated by functional differentiation with respect to the metric. This approach, based on proper time expansion of the Green's function of the dynamical operator that describes the evolution of the quantum field, can be used to investigate effects like the vacuum polarization of massive fields in curved backgrounds, whenever the Compton's wavelenght of the field is less than the characteristic radius of curvature \cite{DeWitt,frolov-zelnikov,avramidi,AHS,matyjasek1,matyjasek,berej-matyjasek,popov,owen1,owen2,Folacci}.

In a previous paper \cite{owenmonopole1} we took the first step in the investigation of vacuum polarization effects of quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a point-like global monopole, using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique to obtain analytical expressions for the field fluctuation \(\langle\varphi^{2}\rangle_{ren}\) in this background spacetime. We used the simple model, discovered by Barriola and Vilenkin \cite{barriola-vilenkin}, which leads to global monopoles as heavy objects appeared in the early universe as a result of a phase transition of a self-coupled scalar field triplet whose original global $O(3)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken to $U(1)$. In this systems, the scalar field plays the role of order parameter which is nonzero outside the monopole's core, where it is concentrated the main part of the monopole's energy.

Previous works that consider quantum fields in global monopole systems includes the analysis of massless scalar fields \cite{hiscock,mazzitely-lousto,bezerra1}, and the calculation of the quantum stress energy tensor for a massless spinor field \cite{bezerra2,bezerra3}.

In \cite{owenmonopole1}, we construct various approximations for $<\phi^{2}>$, each one proportional to the coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coeficcient $\left[a_{k}\right]$, starting from the leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{2}\right]$, up to the next to next to next to leading term, that include the coincident limits of coefficients up to $\left[a_{5}\right]$. In terms of the mass $\mu$ of the quantum scalar field, the leading approximation lead to $<\phi^{2}>$ proportional to $\mu^{-2}$, whereas the higher order approximation involve powers $\mu^{-8}$.  We also find the trace of the renormalized stress energy tensor for the quantized field in the leading approximation, using the existing relationship between this magnitude, the trace anomaly and the field fluctuation.

The results obtained in \cite{owenmonopole1} for the field fluctuations of the quantized massive scalar field in the global monopole background shows that taking into account higher order terms substantially improve the approximation, for which we concluded that for this spacetimes, we need to use the next to next to next to leading term to obtain a good description of the vacuum polarization.

This situation was in contrast with that obtained for other spacetimes with spherical symmetry, as the one describing a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, for which previous studies showed that the next to leading term, proportional to $\left[a_{3}\right]$, provides a reasonable good approximation \cite{matyjasek4}.

In this paper we continue the study of vacuum polarization effects in the spacetime of the global monopole. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt approach, we construct an analytic expression of the four dimensional renormalized quantum effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to a generic spacetime. This expression, which is an expansion in powers of the square of the inverse mass of the quantum field, proportional to coincident limit of the Hadamard-DeWitt coefficient $\left[a_{3}\right]$, is used to obtain the leading approximation for the renormalized quantum stress energy tensor of the quantum field by functional differentiation with respect to the metric

","\section{The quantum effective action and the renormalized stress energy tensor}

\subsection{The quantum effective action}

We consider the effective action for a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the gravitational field of a generic spacetime. The effective action, denoted by $\Gamma$, is a functional of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and the field $\varphi$, which can be written as

\begin{equation}
\Gamma[g_{\mu\nu},\varphi]=\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\left(\frac{1}{16\pi G}\left(R-2\Lambda\right)+V\right)+\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mu}\varphi\right)\left(\nabla^{\mu}\varphi\right)-\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\varphi^{2}\right)
\end{equation}

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $V$ is the potential of the scalar field, $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant and $m$ is the mass of the scalar field. The effective action $\Gamma$ is a functional of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and the field $\varphi$, and it is defined as the Legendre transform of the Euler-Lagrange action functional"

Comment: What is the Schwinger-DeWitt approach? How does it relate to vacuum polarization effects of massive fields in curved backgrounds? Provide an overview of its application in obtaining analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action.

Answer: The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a technique used in quantum field theory to calculate the effective action of a quantum field in a curved spacetime. The effective action is a functional of the field, and it encodes all the quantum corrections to the classical action. The Schwinger-DeWitt approach involves expanding the effective action in powers of the curvature tensor, which allows one to obtain analytical expressions for the effective action.

The vacuum polarization effects of massive fields in curved backgrounds arise due to the interaction of the field with the background geometry. This interaction can lead to the emission and absorption of gravitons, which in turn can modify the effective action. The Schwinger-DeWitt approach can be used to calculate these vacuum polarization effects and incorporate them into the effective action.

In summary, the Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a technique for calculating the effective action of a quantum field in a curved spacetime, taking into account the vacuum polarization effects of massive fields"

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is a method for calculating the quantum effective action in curved spacetime. It involves solving the path integral for the quantum effective action, which is the generating functional for the one-loop quantum corrections to the classical action. The quantum effective action contains information about the quantum fluctuations of the fields and their interaction with the background geometry.

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach is particularly useful for analyzing the vacuum polarization effects of massive fields in curved backgrounds. In this case, the quantum effective action contains contributions from the quantum fluctuations of the massive fields, which can be interpreted as vacuum polarization effects. These vacuum polarization effects can have significant impacts on the behavior of the fields and their interaction with the background geometry.

The Schwinger-DeWitt approach can be applied to obtain analytical expressions for the one-loop quantum effective action. This involves solving the path integral for the quantum effective action in terms of the background geometry and the fields, and then using techniques such as zeta-function regularization to evaluate the integral. The resulting expression for the quantum effective action contains information about the quantum fluctuations of the fields and their interaction with the background geometry.

One of the unresolved problems in fundamental physics is the problem of the electron's internal structure.
In classical physics, this problem manifests itself in the fact that a point charge possesses an infinite mass related to the energy
of the electrostatic field created by the charge. In quantum electrodynamics, a point electron leads to the occurrence of divergences in loop graphs.

Apparently, a first attempt to resolve this problem has been made by Abraham and Lorentz within the theory of an electron suggested in Refs.~\cite{ablo,ablo1}.
Another attempt to resolve the problem is Wheeler's idea of `charge without charge'~\cite{wheelbook} where an electric charge is regarded as a
wormhole containing force lines of an electric field. Within such model, the region where the force lines enter the wormhole looks like a negative charge,
and the region where the force lines emerge from the wormhole mimics a positive charge. Also, numerous attempts have been made to find regular solutions
in classical and nonlinear electrodynamics both in the presence  and in the absence of the gravitational
field~\cite{Born:1934gh,heis,Markov:1970hv,Markov:1972sc,Bronnikov:1979ex,Datzeff:1980tg,Bonnor:1989iw,Davidson:1992kr,Herr:1994,Zaslavskii:2010yi,Finst:1999,Bronn:2000,Habib:2009,Zaslav:2010,Dzhunushaliev:2016bnh}.
One should also definitely mention the popular approach to the classical model of an electron using the Einstein-Dirac~\cite{Finster:1998ws}
and Kerr-Newman~\cite{KNold,KNold1,KNold2,KNold3,KNold4,KNold5,KNold6,KNold7} solutions (an extensive bibliography on the subject can be found in Ref.~\cite{Burinskii:2011id}).

In the present paper we consider a model of an electron on the assumption that its internal structure is determined by quantum gravitational effects.
We suppose that such effects can be approximately described by modified Weyl gravity suggested in Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.
This enables us to represent the electron as a composite object whose interior region is described by modified Weyl gravity and the exterior region~-- by Minkowski spacetime. In turn, in both regions, there is a Dirac spinor field that ensures the presence of a spin of $1/2$ in the system. To describe the interior region, we will use the solution obtained in  Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom} which is embedded in an exterior flat spacetime. In addition, notice that, since Weyl gravity (as well as modified Weyl gravity considered here) is conformally invariant, metrics differing by a conformal factor are the same solution. Physically this can be interpreted  as the presence in the interior region of fluctuations of the metric conformal factor

","\section{Modified Weyl gravity}

In the present section we briefly discuss the model of modified Weyl gravity proposed in Ref.~\cite{Dzhunushaliev:2020dom}.

\subsection{Lagrangian}

The Lagrangian of the theory is given by
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \sqrt{-g}\left[\frac{1}{16\pi G} \left(R + \frac{6}{c^2} \right) - \frac{1}{16\pi G} \left(R + \frac{6}{c^2}\right) \right]~,
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $R$ is the Ricci scalar.

\subsection{Equations of motion}

The Einstein field equations in the presence of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}~,
\end{equation}
where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor, $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor, and $G$ is the gravitational constant.

""How might the proposed framework for understanding the internal structure of electrons using Modified Weyl Gravity be extended to other fundamental particles, such as quarks and neutrinos, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between particles and gravity at the quantum level?""
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

Answer: The proposed framework for understanding the internal structure of electrons using Modified Weyl Gravity could be extended to other fundamental particles, such as quarks and neutrinos, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between particles and gravity at the quantum level. This extension would involve incorporating quantum gravitational effects into the study of these other particles, which could reveal new insights into their internal structure and behavior.

For example, researchers could investigate the role of quantum gravitational effects in quarks, which are the building blocks of protons and neutrons. Understanding the internal structure of quarks and their interactions with gravity could provide valuable information about the strong force, which governs the behavior of hadrons like protons and neutrons.

Similarly, neutrinos are known to have very small masses and weak interactions, which make them difficult to study. Incorporating quantum gravitational effects into the study of neutrinos could help physicists better understand their internal structure and behavior, potentially leading to new insights into the nature of dark matter and the mysterious process of neutrino oscillation.

By extending the proposed framework to other fundamental particles, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between particles and gravity at the quantum level. This could lead to new insights into the fundamental forces that govern the universe and the nature of the particles that make up matter"

The research found that an innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers.

A similar inbuilt instinct may be the reason why girls have always liked to play with dolls, cosmetics or toys based on domestic life, it said.

An innate drive pushes boys to prefer trucks and cars and aggressive toys such as guns or toy soldiers

But the impact of feminism on parents, advertising and media may be a reason why girls have been less keen on dolls, make-up and kitchen toys in recent years, according to the research paper.

Girls are more likely than boys to be influenced as they grow up by parents, the adults and children around them, and what they read and see on television, it said, while boys stick to boys’ toys.

The study produced by a team led by psychologists from City, University of London, was based on evidence collected by different researchers across the Western world over decades, with some dating back to the 1930s.

It said: ‘Despite methodological variation in the choice and number of toys offered, context of testing, and age of child, the consistency in finding sex differences in children’s preferences for toys typed to their own gender indicates the strength of this phenomenon and the likelihood that it has a biological origin.’

The paper added that there were robust differences between the toy choices of girls and boys, and that this was so across decades and in different experiments.

This, the study said, ‘indicates an innate influence on this behaviour.’

The findings come at a time of deepening controversy over the choice of toys made by children, and heightened awareness over transgender issues.

The study found that 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with more fashionable than traditional toys. Aeroplanes were popular, which may have been to do with Amelia Earhart (pictured) and other female aviators

Last week the Church of England told schools that in the interest of avoiding transgender bullying, teachers in its schools should ensure ‘a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment.’

The City study said that even more than 80 years ago girls were interested in playing with toys that were more fashionable than traditional.

In 1932, an experiment ‘found that girls played with a toy aeroplane for similar times to boys.’

This may have been because at the time ‘female aviators were in the news; Amy Johnson flew from England to Australia in 1930, and Amelia Earhart flew solo across the Atlantic in 1932.’

Some attempts to study children found that boys tended to play aggressively even if they were given traditional girls’ toys.

‘Other toys, not necessarily male-typed, can afford aggressive play,’ the study said.

In 1980, it said, one set of psychologists ‘noted in their observation that boys played with a toy food mixer as if it were a machine gun.’

In recent times, girls have been less likely to play with dolls and other toys once considered female.

The Church of England told schools 'a child may choose the tutu, princess’s tiara and heels and/or the fireman’s helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak without expectation or comment'. Pictured: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby

‘One interpretation is that , over the years, girls have been exposed to increasing pressure to play with neutral-typed toys as the volume of advertising to children and expansion on the number and type of children’s media outlets have increased enormously,’ it said.

Dr Brenda Todd of City, University of London, said: ‘What we found is that as boys get older we see increased play with toys typed to their gender

\label{intro}

Gravitational accretion of matter onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) that resides in the center of most, if not all, galaxies is what powers active galactic nuclei (AGN, \citealt{Rees84}). This very efficient process produces large amounts of energy across the entire spectrum that can be detected at cosmological distances. Not only is radiation emitted, but also large amounts of matter are injected back into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. This process is known as feedback, and it is believed to play a major role in the coevolution of the SMBH and the galaxy (\citealt{DM05}; \citealt{HE10}).

More than half of the observed type-1 AGN present signatures of photoionized gas in their soft X-ray spectrum, the so-called warm absorbers (WA), that are seen as absorption features superimposed to the continuum (e.g., \citealt{Rey97}; \citealt{Geo98}; \citealt{Cre03}). With the advent of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy after the launch of {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and {\sl Chandra}{}, it was observed that these absorbers were blueshifted with respect to the rest frame of their host galaxy, typically by hundreds to thousands of km s$^{-1}$ (\citealt{Kaa00}; \citealt{Kas01}). Since they were outflowing, they were injecting kinetic energy and mass back into the ISM and therefore they were potential candidates to be a source of cosmic feedback. It is now considered that the regular WAs have, in general, little impact on their surroundings, with the exception of their most extreme version: outflows with very high velocity, ionization state, and column density, known as ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), which can have a significant impact on their host galaxy (\citealt{Tom12, Tom13}; \citealt{Laha16}).

The dominant launching mechanism of these outflows is still a matter of debate as they present a wide range of velocities, degrees of ionization, and column densities. They range from thermal winds arising the from inner edge of the torus, which is eroded by the intense radiation field (\citealt{KK01}), and winds launched from the accretion disk by radiative means (\citealt{PK04}) or magnetohydrodynamical mechanisms (\citealt{KK94}; \citealt{Fuk10a, Fuk10b}). In addition to this, after many years of observations and monitoring of AGN, another type of transient wind has been identified and studied: high-column density, fast, obscuring winds that eclipse the inner X-ray source of AGN on relatively short time scales. A number of objects have now shown this kind of transient phenomenon, for instance NGC 1365 (\citealt{Ris07}), Mrk 766 (\citealt{Ris11}), Mrk 335 (\citealt{Lon13, Lon19}), NGC 5548 (\citealt{Kaa14}), NGC 3783 (\citealt{Meh17}), and now also NGC 985 (\citealt{Ebr16}). 

NGC 985, also known as Mrk 1048, is a nearby ($z = 0.043$, \citealt{Fis95}), bright ($F_{\rm 0.3-10~keV} = 2.2 \times 10^{-11}$~erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, \citealt{Ebr16}) Seyfert 1 galaxy with a distinctive ring shape, produced by a recent galactic merger. This source is known to host a WA in X-rays (\citealt{Kro05,Kro09}) as well as an UV absorber (\citealt{Ara02}). During a {\sl Swift}{}~monitoring program in 2013, the source was found to be in a very low soft X-ray flux state. A triggered joint {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST observation found that some intervening very dense gas was occulting the central X-ray source (\citealt{Par14}). In the most recent observations in 2015, taken 12 days apart also with {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~and HST, we found that the source was emerging from this obscured state. The first analysis of the X-ray broad band and UV spectra were presented in \citet{Ebr16}

","\section{Data}

The X-ray spectra were obtained with the EPIC-pn instrument onboard {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~in Small Window mode (with the exception of the 2015 observation, where it was in Full Window mode). The UV spectra were obtained with the STIS instrument onboard {\sl HST}{}~in the FUV channel (G140L). The data reduction and calibration of the X-ray spectra was performed using the {\sl XMM-Newton}{}~Science Analysis System (SAS) v.15.0.0. The UV spectra were reduced using the STSDAS v.12.0.2 within IRAF v.2.16.0.

\section{Results}

\subsection{X-rays}

The 2013 and 2015 observations were taken in different states of the source. The 2013 observation was taken when the source was in a very low flux state, while the 2015 observation was taken when the source was emerging from a very obscured state. The 2015 observation was also taken with a different instrumental setup, which explains the differences in the spectral analysis.

Answer:
X-ray broad band and UV spectra are important for understanding the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to unobscured active galaxy because they provide unique insights into the structure and activity of the accretion disk and the surrounding environment.

In the X-ray band, the broad band spectrum can reveal information about the shape of the accretion disk, the presence of any obscuring material, and the strength of the radiation emitted from the inner regions of the disk. This information can help to understand the physical processes involved in the transition, such as the dissipation of obscuring material or the emergence of a newly formed accretion disk.

In the UV band, the spectrum can provide information about the ionizing radiation from the central source and the absorption properties of the surrounding material. This can help to determine the ionization state of the gas and dust in the environment, which can be affected by the change in the AGN's luminosity and the dissipation of obscuring material.

Additionally, the X-ray and UV spectra can be used in combination with other observational techniques, such as optical and infrared observations, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the physical processes at play during the transition. For example, optical and infrared data can help to identify any changes in the morphology or structure of the host galaxy"

Previous Question 
Question:What type of data did Ebrero et al. (2016) analyze to gain insights into the physical processes during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN?
Answer:Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
Ebrero et al. (2016) analyzed data from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to gain insights into the physical processes during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured AGN.
Step 2: Understand what is being asked.
The question asks about the type of data that was analyzed by Ebrero et al. (2016) to understand this transition.
Step 3: Provide a clear answer.
Ebrero et al. (2016) used X-ray broad band and UV spectra obtained from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to analyze and gain insights into the physical processes occurring during this transition.
Therefore, my answer would be:
'Ebrero et al. (2016) analyzed X-ray broad band and UV spectra obtained from both XMM-Newton and HST observatories to gain insights into the physical processes taking place as an active galaxy undergoes a transformation from an obscured state to an unobscured state.'
Question:Sure! Here's a question based on the previous context and questions:
'Can you elaborate on why studying X-ray broad band and UV spectra are particularly important for understanding the physical processes involved in the transition from an obscured to unobscured active galaxy, as demonstrated by Ebrero et al. (2016)? What unique information do these two spectral bands provide that other observational techniques may not capture?'
Answer:What are some other important insights or findings that Ebrero et al. (2016) presented in their article regarding the transition of the active galaxy from an obscured to an unobscured state?

 In addition to analyzing the X-ray broad band and UV spectra, Ebrero et al. (2016) also reported on several other significant findings related to the transition of the active galaxy. They observed a decrease in X-ray absorption, indicating a reduction in obscuring material surrounding the central supermassive black hole. The researchers also noted an increase in UV emission, suggesting an enhancement in the accretion rate onto the black hole during this transformation. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex physical processes occurring during this transition and contribute to our understanding of how active galaxies evolve over time.
Question:Sure thing! Based on the last piece, here are the major takeaways in tweet format:

🔥 Key findings: Ebrero et al. (2016) studied an active galaxy's transition from obscurbed to unobscured state using XMM-Newton & HST observations.

Question:Sure! Here's a thought-provoking question based on the context and previous answers:

""Given that the decreased X-ray absorption and increased UV emission during the transformation from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy suggest a change in the accretion mechanism, do you think there could be any implications for our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and coevolution with their host galaxies?""
Answer the question step by step and explain your thoughts. Do not include questions or summaries in your answer.","

Step 1: Identify the key information in the question.
The question is asking if the observed changes in the accretion mechanism during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy could have implications for our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and coevolution with their host galaxies.
Step 2: Understand what is being asked.
The question is asking for my thoughts on the potential implications of the observed changes in the accretion mechanism during this transition on our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and coevolution with their host galaxies.
Step 3: Provide a clear answer.
Yes, I believe the observed changes in the accretion mechanism during the transition from an obscured to an unobscured active galaxy could have significant implications for our understanding of supermassive black hole growth and coevolution with their host galaxies. This transition is likely driven by changes in the physical environment around the black hole, which may impact the accretion rate and, in turn, the growth of the black hole. Additionally, understanding the factors that trigger this transition could provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate the coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies.

Fourteen primary and intermediate schools in the area have teamed up with a local trust to create the programme Fuel the Need.

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

Fuel the Need is being run by Manuel Dalton, who runs the Dalton's Gym Charitable Trust, which in turn operates a community based gym in Upper Hutt City.

Mr Dalton is a self-described Upper Hutt boy, an ex-soldier with a philanthropic drive to help out the community where he was born and bred.

At the end of 2014 he met with principals from schools in the region so they could work out what the need was. The group deduced about 50 children a day were turning up to school without lunch, although he believed that could be on the conservative side.

""To me that was a big enough number to prompt me to do something about it.""

Mr Dalton immediately got to work, getting the gym's chiller reinstated, having two people get food handling and hygeine certificates and getting approval in principle from the council to run the operations.

There is a database of about 20 people willing to volunteer their time to the programme, and a deal has been struck with Pak 'n Save to supply the food at $3 per lunch which includes a sandwich, yoghurt, and piece of fruit and a museli bar.

The programme needs about $30,000 a year funding. Mr Dalton has sent about 300 emails to local businesses, but has had only had two replies - both of which were a 'thanks, but no thanks'.

Mr Dalton said the response was disappointing and he planned to make further contact with businesses.

""I'm not trying to sound harsh but if there are businesses that are making money off our community then I'm sort of garnering towards making them socially responsible to give back to the community that it makes money from.""

Trentham School is one of the schools that would benefit from the initiative.

The decile 5 primary school has about 406 pupils for whom many English is a second language.

Trentham's principal Suzanne Su'a said every week a handful of pupils turn up with empty stomachs and nothing for the day which has an impact on their learning and behaviour.

""For us to not have food at home that you can bring to school is a real concern, you know we deal with the five days a week, there's still the weekend.""

Photo: RNZ / Kate Gudsell

At the beginning of every term the school makes sandwiches that it freezes and then defrosts when they are needed, but the school hopes the Fuel the Need initiative will supplement that.

Mrs Su'a said the number of children in need varies year from year. She describes it as quite a transient school with pupils coming in who will leave part way through the year, and others that return.

She said the school does not have hard data on why the children may not have food, but the teachers make judgements through observation and sometimes what the children say.

""For some it's purely just lack of money and trying to make their weekly budget stretch through, sometimes you can tell on certain days when kids don't have lunch, the benefit might not come through until the next couple of days so for a lot of our families it is to do with financial poverty, and then we might have some families who it comes down to poor management by parents in regards to finances.""

Mrs Su'a was disappointed by the response from local businesses - as was the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce which worked with Mr Dalton to help get the initiative off the ground.

Chief executive Mark Futter said it was a great concept and he was astounded no businesses had come forward to help.

""I'm genuinely surprised to be perfectly honest 

Summarize the preceding context in 5 sentences. Do not try to create questions or answers for your summarization.

","Fuel the Need is a great initiative, and it's something that we can all support.

I think it's a great initiative and I'm very disappointed that no businesses have come forward to support it.""

Mr Futter said he believed the businesses that had not supported the initiative had made a mistake.

""I think they've made a big mistake, I think it's a great initiative and I think they're missing out on a great opportunity to support the community.""

Mr Dalton said he was still hopeful the initiative would go ahead.

""We're not giving up, we're still going to keep trying to get it off the ground.""

He said the community should not be afraid to ask for help.

""I think people should be asking for help, I think people should be asking for help from businesses, from the government, from anybody that can help, I think people should be asking for help.""

He said the community should be prepared to help each other.

""I think that's what makes a community, you know, you help your neighbour, you help your neighbour's neighbour, you help your neighbour's neighbour's neighbour, you know, that's what makes a community.""

The programme would be a good way to give back to the community, he said.

\label{intro_sec}

One of the most long-standing puzzles in stellar astrophysics is represented by 
the observed dichotomy in the mean period of globular cluster (GC) RR Lyrae 
variables pulsating in their fundamental mode (RR0). This evidence, first discovery 
by Grosse (1932) and Hachenberg (1939), was studied by Oosterhoff (1939, 
1944) who noted that GCs can be divided in two groups according to the mean
period of their RR0 variables: a first group with
$\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.55~d$ (OoI) and a second group of clusters with significantly 
longer mean periods $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.65~d$ (OoII). Kinman (1959) noticed that the
subdivision of the two groups correlates with the clusters' metal content with 
the OoI group constituted by relatively
metal-rich ($-1.6<[Fe/H]<-1.0$) clusters and the OoII group comprising the most 
metal-poor ones ($[Fe/H]<-1.6$). Clusters of the two groups have also
differences in their relative fraction of first overtone (RR1) pulsator and
different horizontal branch (HB) morphologies (Stobie 1971).
A third group (OoIII) populated by two very metal-rich clusters ($[Fe/H]\sim-0.45$; 
NGC6388 and NGC6441)
which exhibit a long $\langle P_{ab}\rangle\sim0.75~d$ has been later defined (Pritzl et al.
2000). Only few clusters have a mean RR0 
period in the intermediate range $0.58<\langle P_{ab}\rangle<0.62$ (the
so-called ""Oosterhoff gap""). Although at the epoch of the original
discovery of the Oosterhoff dichotomy, the surveys of variable stars were limited to only 5 
GCs, its significance has been confirmed
in the subsequent years when large samples of RR0 have been observed in many GCs. 
The same behavior has been observed among field RR0 populating the Galactic halo
(Sandage 1982a; Suntzeff, Kinman \& Kraft 1991; Miceli et al. 2008; Szczygie{\l}, Pojma{\'n}ski \& Pilecki 2009).
For decades the true nature of the Oosterhoff dichotomy has been debated
and many solutions have been proposed (see Catelan 2009 for a recent review). 
The first attempts to interpret this evidence focused their attention on the
temperature of the edges of the instability strip (Schwarzschild 1957) and on 
the mean luminosity of the HB (Sandage 1957)
