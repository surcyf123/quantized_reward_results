In 1916, H.~Weyl posed the following problem: \emph{Given a metric $g$
of positive Gauss curvature on the sphere $\S^2$, is there an embedding
${\mathbf X}\colon\S^2\to\mathbb R^3$ such that the metric induced on $\S^2$ by this
embedding is $g$?} Such an embedding ${\mathbf X}\colon (\S^2,g) \to \mathbb R^3$ is
called {\em isometric}, and satisfies the following system of nonlinear
partial differential equations:
\begin{equation}        \label{eq:iso}
        \nabla_i X \cdot \nabla _j X = g_{ij}.
\end{equation}

In~\cite{weyl16}, Weyl suggested the continuity method to attack the
problem and obtained a priori estimates up to the second derivatives of
the embedding.  The a priori estimate of the second derivative is a
consequence of the Weyl inequality which gives a bound of the mean
curvature by intrinsic quantities for strictly convex closed surfaces;
see Theorem~\ref{thm:weyl}. The main obstacle to the solution was the
lack of $\cal C^{2,\alpha}$ a priori estimates for the embedding.


Later H.~Lewy solved the problem under the assumption that the metric
$g$ is real analytic; see~\cite{lewy38}. It is interesting to point out
that Lewy did not use Weyl's a priori estimate. In~\cite{nirenberg53a},
L.~Nirenberg gave a beautiful proof for any metric $g$ of class $\cal C^4$.
He established, among other things, the $\cal C^{2,\alpha}$ a priori
estimate of the embedding using strong a priori estimates  he derived
earlier for solutions of  fully non-linear elliptic partial differential
equations in two variables; see~\cite{nirenberg53}. An entirely
different approach was taken independently by A.~D.~Alexandroff and
A.~V.~Pogorelov; see~\cite{alexandroff48,pogorelov49,pogorelov49a}. The
Weyl estimate was later generalized to the case of non-negative
curvature by P.~Guan and Y.~Li in~\cite{guanli94}.  From their estimate,
they obtained a $\cal C^{1,1}$ embedding result for metrics of non-negative
Gauss curvature; see also~\cite{hong95} for a different approach to the
$\cal C^{1,1}$ embedding result.


The main result of this paper is a Weyl-type estimate, see
Theorem~\ref{thm:guanli94} below, which generalizes to higher dimensions
the estimate of P.~Guan and the first author. The theorem asserts that
for any convex closed hypersurface in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$, ($n\ge 2$), one can
bound the mean curvature $H$ in terms of the scalar curvature of the
induced metric $g$, its Laplacian, and the diameter.

Denote by $\cal M^k(\S^n)$ the space of metrics $g$ of non-negative
sectional curvature on $\S^n$ which have $k$ continuous derivatives, and
by $\cal M^k_+(\S^n)\subset\cal M^k(\S^n)$ the subset consisting of those
metrics which have positive sectional curvature.  Similarly, if
$0<\alpha<1$, we denote by $\cal M^{k,\alpha}(\S^n)\subset\cal M^k(\S^n)$ the
space of metrics $g\in\cal M^k(\S^n)$ whose $k$-th derivatives are H\""older
continuous, and by $\cal M^{k,\alpha}_+(\S^n)\subset\cal M^{k,\alpha}(\S^n)$ the
subset consisting of those metrics which have positive sectional
curvature.  For convenience, we will denote $\cal M^{k,0}(\S^n)=\cal M^k(\S^n)$,
$\cal M^{k,0}_+(\S^n)=\cal M^k_+(\S^n)$, and adopt the same convention for
spaces of functions, i.e.,\xspace $\cal C^{k,0}=\cal C^k$.

\begin{thm}     \label{thm:guanli94}
Let $g\in\cal M^4(\S^n)$, and let ${\mathbf X}\colon(\S^n,g)\to\mathbb R^{n+1}$ be a $\cal C^4$
isometric embedding

These graphs have vertices representing elements in an algebra, and edges between vertices are based on properties of term operations within the algebra. Edges are divided into two types - thin and thick (thick edges include unary, semilattice, majority, and affine types).
Previous Question 
Question:Prompt Focus: The prompt is centered around a mathematical research paper authored by Bulatov et al., exploring the intersection of graph theory and algebra. They construct unique graphs for specific algebras and investigate their topological structure. The study considers various types of edges, which are classified as ""thin"" or ""thick"".

Question to consider from the provided context: How do different edge categories reflect specific algebraic structures and operations in Bulatov et al.'s analysis? In other words, how does one interpret thin vs. thick edges and what specific terms they associate with each classification?
Answer:In Bulatov et al.'s analysis, thin edges represent simpler algebraic structures such as singletons and pairs, while thick edges represent more complex structures like majority functions and affine operations. Thick edges are essential for capturing key algebraic properties such as compatibility and commutativity. The thin-to-thick ratio can also provide insights into the computational complexity of algorithms related to these graphs. Ultimately, understanding the interplay between thin and thick edges helps identify algebraic structures that exhibit interesting graph-theoretic properties.

Question:The key takeaways from the text are that edge categories in graph theory have a direct correlation with algebraic structures and operations. Different edge types can represent different types of algebraic structures, and this understanding can help to identify graph-theoretic properties that are relevant to the algebraic structure being studied. Additionally, the thin-to-thick ratio can provide insights into the computational complexity of algorithms related to these graphs.

In the United States, bladder cancer is the fourth and ninth most
widespread cancer among males and females, respectively, whereas in
Europe, approximately 50,000 people die from this disease each year
\cite{Alcaraz:2007}. Due to the high recurrence rate of $50\%$,
lifetime monitoring of patients is required after surgical removal of
cancer tumors \cite{Holzbeierlein:2004}. During a cystoscopy, a
flexible or rigid endoscope is inserted into the bladder through the
urethra, and a video of the epithelium is visualized on a screen. The
clinician (urologist or surgeon) scans the epithelium by maintaining
the distal tip of the cystoscope close to the internal organ wall. The
resulting highly resolved videos yield accurate visualization of the
wall through small field of view (FOV) images. However, neither
complete regions of interest (multifocal lesions, scares, etc.) nor
anatomical landmarks (urethra, ureters, air bubbles) are visible in
these images. Therefore, lesion diagnosis and follow-up may be
difficult and time-consuming. Extended FOV mosaics can be obtained by
superimposing the regions which can be jointly observed in small FOV
images. Not only do they facilitate lesion diagnosis and follow-up,
but they are also useful for data archiving (videos are highly
redundant data) and medical traceability (videos are not easy to
interpret by a clinician having not performed the acquisition).

\subsection{Bladder image mosaicing}
Bi-dimensional (2D) bladder image mosaicing algori\-thms were proposed
for the standard white-light modality \cite{Bergen13,Miranda2008} and
for the fluorescence modality \cite{Behrens:2008}. A complete
mosaicing algorithm consists of \emph{(i)} the registration of
consecutive images of the video sequence~\cite{Hernandez:2010},
\emph{(ii)} the correction of image misalignment in the mosaic leading
to bladder texture discontinuities \cite{Weibel:2012a}, and
\emph{(iii)} the contrast, intensity and/or color correction to handle
image blurring, shading effects and/or instrument viewpoint changes
\cite{Behrens:2010,Weibel2012b}. In \cite{Weibel:2012a}, it was shown
that mosaics covering large bladder surfaces (\emph{e.g.}, half of the
organ) can be computed. Although such 2D mosaics (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:1}) facilitate lesion diagnosis and follow-up, these
representations can be improved. Indeed, only the first image of the
mosaic has the original image resolution, the resolution of the other
images depending on the instrument trajectory and orientation.
Moreover, these images are strongly distorted during their placement
into the 2D map due to perspective changes of the endoscope
